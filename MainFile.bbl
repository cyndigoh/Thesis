    BACKGROUND: The etiopathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to
  include genetic and environmental factors. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
  alleles, in particular, are associated with disease susceptibility, whereas
  Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection has long been suspected to play a role in
  disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate
  correlations between HLA alleles and EBV infection in MS. METHODS: HLA
  alleles, EBV viral load (VL) and serum anti-EBV antibody titers were
  evaluated in EBV-seropositive MS patients (N = 117) and age- and sex-matched
  healthy controls (HC; N = 89). RESULTS: Significantly higher DNA viral loads
  (p = 0.048) and EBNA-1 antibody titer (p = 0.0004) were seen in MS compared
  to HC. EBV VL was higher in HLA-B*07+ (p = 0.02) and HLA-DRB1*15+ (p = 0.02)
  MS patients, whereas it was lower in HLA-A*02+ (p = 0.04) subjects. EBV VL
  was highest in HLA-A*02-/B*07+/DRB1*15+ patients and lowest in
  HLA-A*A02+/B*07-/DRB1*15- individuals (p < 0.0001). HLA-B*07 resulted the
  most associated allele to EBV VL after multiple regression analysis
  considering altogether the three alleles, (p = 0.0001). No differences were
  observed in anti-EBV antibody titers in relationship with HLA distribution.
  CONCLUSIONS: Host HLA-B*07 allele influence EBV VL in MS. As HLA-class I
  molecules present antigens to T lymphocytes and initiate immune response
  against viruses, these results could support a role for EBV in MS.%

    We report a platform that increases the sensitivity of high-throughput
  sequencing for detection and characterization of bacteria, virulence
  determinants, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The system uses a
  probe set comprised of 4.2 million oligonucleotides based on the Pathosystems
  Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) database, the Comprehensive Antibiotic
  Resistance Database (CARD), and the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB),
  representing 307 bacterial species that include all known human-pathogenic
  species, known antimicrobial resistance genes, and known virulence factors,
  respectively. The use of bacterial capture sequencing (BacCapSeq) resulted in
  an up to 1,000-fold increase in bacterial reads from blood samples and
  lowered the limit of detection by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to
  conventional unbiased high-throughput sequencing, down to a level comparable
  to that of agent-specific real-time PCR with as few as 5 million total reads
  generated per sample. It detected not only the presence of AMR genes but also
  biomarkers for AMR that included both constitutive and differentially
  expressed transcripts.IMPORTANCE BacCapSeq is a method for differential
  diagnosis of bacterial infections and defining antimicrobial sensitivity
  profiles that has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, health
  care costs, and the inappropriate use of antibiotics that contributes to the
  development of antimicrobial resistance.%

    UNLABELLED: In vivo transcriptional analyses of microbial pathogens are
  often hampered by low proportions of pathogen biomass in host organs,
  hindering the coverage of full pathogen transcriptome. We aimed to address
  the transcriptome profiles of Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal
  pathogen in systemically infected immunocompromised patients, during systemic
  infection in different hosts. We developed a strategy for high-resolution
  quantitative analysis of the C. albicans transcriptome directly from early
  and late stages of systemic infection in two different host models, mouse and
  the insect Galleria mellonella. Our results show that transcriptome
  sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were enriched for fungal transcripts up to
  1,600-fold using biotinylated bait probes to capture C. albicans sequences.
  This enrichment biased the read counts of only ~3% of the genes, which can be
  identified and removed based on a priori criteria. This allowed an
  unprecedented resolution of C. albicans transcriptome in vivo, with detection
  of over 86% of its genes. The transcriptional response of the fungus was
  surprisingly similar during infection of the two hosts and at the two time
  points, although some host- and time point-specific genes could be
  identified. Genes that were highly induced during infection were involved,
  for instance, in stress response, adhesion, iron acquisition, and biofilm
  formation. Of the in vivo-regulated genes, 10% are still of unknown function,
  and their future study will be of great interest. The fungal RNA enrichment
  procedure used here will help a better characterization of the C. albicans
  response in infected hosts and may be applied to other microbial pathogens.
  IMPORTANCE: Understanding the mechanisms utilized by pathogens to infect and
  cause disease in their hosts is crucial for rational drug development.
  Transcriptomic studies may help investigations of these mechanisms by
  determining which genes are expressed specifically during infection. This
  task has been difficult so far, since the proportion of microbial biomass in
  infected tissues is often extremely low, thus limiting the depth of
  sequencing and comprehensive transcriptome analysis. Here, we adapted a
  technology to capture and enrich C. albicans RNA, which was next used for
  deep RNA sequencing directly from infected tissues from two different host
  organisms. The high-resolution transcriptome revealed a large number of genes
  that were so far unknown to participate in infection, which will likely
  constitute a focus of study in the future. More importantly, this method may
  be adapted to perform transcript profiling of any other microbes during host
  infection or colonization.%

    This protocol details the steps for data quality assessment and control
  that are typically carried out during case-control association studies. The
  steps described involve the identification and removal of DNA samples and
  markers that introduce bias. These critical steps are paramount to the
  success of a case-control study and are necessary before statistically
  testing for association. We describe how to use PLINK, a tool for handling
  SNP data, to perform assessments of failure rate per individual and per SNP
  and to assess the degree of relatedness between individuals. We also detail
  other quality-control procedures, including the use of SMARTPCA software for
  the identification of ancestral outliers. These platforms were selected
  because they are user-friendly, widely used and computationally efficient.
  Steps needed to detect and establish a disease association using case-control
  data are not discussed here. Issues concerning study design and marker
  selection in case-control studies have been discussed in our earlier
  protocols. This protocol, which is routinely used in our labs, should take
  approximately 8 h to complete.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Community-acquired (CA) sepsis is a major public health problem worldwide,
  yet the etiology remains unknown for >50% of the patients. Here we applied
  metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to characterize the human
  virome in 492 clinical samples (384 sera, 92 pooled nasal and throat swabs,
  10 stools, and 6 cerebrospinal fluid samples) from 386 patients (213 adults
  and 173 children) presenting with CA sepsis who were recruited from 6
  hospitals across Vietnam between 2013 and 2015. Specific monoplex PCRs were
  used subsequently to confirm the presence of viral sequences detected by
  mNGS. We found sequences related to 47 viral species belonging to 21 families
  in 358 of 386 (93%) patients, including viruses known to cause human
  infections. After PCR confirmation, human viruses were found in 52 of 386
  patients (13.4%); picornavirus (enteroviruses [n = 14], rhinovirus [n = 5],
  and parechovirus [n = 2]), hepatitis B virus (n = 10), cytomegalovirus (n =
  9), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 5), and rotavirus A (n = 3) were the most common
  viruses detected. Recently discovered viruses were also found
  (gemycircularvirus [n = 5] and WU polyomavirus, Saffold virus, salivirus,
  cyclovirus-VN, and human pegivirus 2 [HPgV2] [n, 1 each]), adding to the
  growing literature about the geographic distribution of these novel viruses.
  Notably, sequences related to numerous viruses not previously reported in
  human tissues were also detected. To summarize, we identified 21 viral
  species known to be infectious to humans in 52 of 386 (13.4%) patients
  presenting with CA sepsis of unknown cause. The study, however, cannot
  directly impute sepsis causation to the viruses identified. The results
  highlight the fact that it remains a challenge to establish the causative
  agents in CA sepsis patients, especially in tropical settings such as
  Vietnam.%

    RATIONALE: There remains uncertainty about the role of corticosteroids in
  sepsis with clear beneficial effects on shock duration, but conflicting
  survival effects. Two transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRSs) have
  been identified. SRS1 is relatively immunosuppressed, whereas SRS2 is
  relatively immunocompetent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to categorize patients based
  on SRS endotypes to determine if these profiles influenced response to either
  norepinephrine or vasopressin, or to corticosteroids in septic shock.
  METHODS: A post hoc analysis was performed of a double-blind, randomized
  clinical trial in septic shock (VANISH [Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine as
  Initial Therapy in Septic Shock]). Patients were included within 6 hours of
  onset of shock and were randomized to receive norepinephrine or vasopressin
  followed by hydrocortisone or placebo. Genome-wide gene expression profiling
  was performed and SRS endotype was determined by a previously established
  model using seven discriminant genes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Samples
  were available from 176 patients: 83 SRS1 and 93 SRS2. There was no
  significant interaction between SRS group and vasopressor assignment (P =
  0.50). However, there was an interaction between assignment to hydrocortisone
  or placebo, and SRS endotype (P = 0.02). Hydrocortisone use was associated
  with increased mortality in those with an SRS2 phenotype (odds ratio = 7.9;
  95% confidence interval = 1.6-39.9). CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic profile at
  onset of septic shock was associated with response to corticosteroids. Those
  with the immunocompetent SRS2 endotype had significantly higher mortality
  when given corticosteroids compared with placebo. Clinical trial registered
  with www.clinicaltrials.gov (ISRCTN 20769191).%

    The capacity of human norovirus (NoV), which causes >90% of global epidemic
  nonbacterial gastroenteritis, to infect a subset of people persistently may
  contribute to its spread. How such enteric viruses establish persistent
  infections is not well understood. We found that antibiotics prevented
  persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection, an effect that was reversed by
  replenishment of the bacterial microbiota. Antibiotics did not prevent tissue
  infection or affect systemic viral replication but acted specifically in the
  intestine. The receptor for the antiviral cytokine interferon-lambda, Ifnlr1,
  as well as the transcription factors Stat1 and Irf3, were required for
  antibiotics to prevent viral persistence. Thus, the bacterial microbiome
  fosters enteric viral persistence in a manner counteracted by specific
  components of the innate immune system.%

    RATIONALE: Studies of long-term functional outcomes of elderly survivors of
  mechanical ventilation (MV) are limited to local samples and biased
  retrospective, proxy-reported preadmission functional status. OBJECTIVES: To
  assess the impact on disability of hospitalization with MV, compared with
  hospitalization without MV, accounting for prospectively assessed prior
  functional status. METHODS: Retrospective population-based longitudinal
  cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older enrolled in the
  Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, 1996-2003. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
  RESULTS: Premeasures and postmeasures of disability included mobility
  difficulty and weighted activities of daily living disability scores ranging
  from 0 (not disabled) to 100 (completely disabled) based on self-reported
  health and functional status collected 1 year apart. Among 54,771
  person-years (PY) of observation over 7 calendar years of data, 42,890 PY
  involved no hospitalization, 11,347 PY involved a hospitalization without MV,
  and 534 PY included a hospitalization with MV. Mortality at 1 year was 8.9%,
  23.9%, and 72.5%, respectively. The level of disability at the postassessment
  was substantially higher for a prototypical patient who survived after
  hospitalization with MV (adjusted activities of daily living disability score
  [95% confidence interval] 14.9 [12.2-17.7]; adjusted mobility difficulty
  score [95% confidence interval] 25.4 [22.4-28.4]) compared with an otherwise
  identical patient who survived hospitalization without MV (11.5 [11.1-11.9]
  and 22.3 [21.8-22.9]) or who was not hospitalized (8.0 [7.9-8.1] and 13.4
  [13.3-13.6]). CONCLUSIONS: The greater marginal increase in disability among
  survivors of MV compared with survivors of hospitalization without MV is
  larger than would be predicted from prior functional status.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem. One-third of the
  world's population is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis (MTB), the etiological agent causing TB, and active disease
  kills nearly 2 million individuals worldwide every year. Several lines of
  evidence indicate that interindividual variation in susceptibility to TB has
  a heritable component, yet we still know little about the underlying genetic
  architecture. To address this, we performed a genome-wide mapping study of
  loci that are associated with functional variation in immune response to MTB.
  Specifically, we characterized transcript and protein expression levels and
  mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in primary dendritic cells
  (DCs) from 65 individuals, before and after infection with MTB. We found 198
  response eQTL, namely loci that were associated with variation in gene
  expression levels in either untreated or MTB-infected DCs, but not both.
  These response eQTL are associated with natural regulatory variation that
  likely affects (directly or indirectly) host interaction with MTB. Indeed,
  when we integrated our data with results from a genome-wide association study
  (GWAS) for pulmonary TB, we found that the response eQTL were more likely to
  be genetically associated with the disease. We thus identified a number of
  candidate loci, including the MAPK phosphatase DUSP14 in particular, that are
  promising susceptibility genes to pulmonary TB.%

    BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dysregulation of miR-223 was recently linked to
  various diseases associated with systemic inflammatory responses such as type
  2 diabetes, cancer, and bacterial infections. However, contradictory results
  are available on potential alterations of miR-223 serum levels during sepsis.
  We thus aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-223
  serum concentrations in patients with critical illness and sepsis. METHODS:
  We used i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as cecal pole
  ligation and puncture (CLP) for induction of polymicrobial sepsis in mice and
  measured alterations in serum levels of miR-223. These results from mice were
  translated into a large and well-characterized cohort of critically ill
  patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). Finally, results
  from analysis in patients were correlated with clinical data and extensive
  sets of routine and experimental biomarkers. RESULTS: Although LPS injection
  induced moderately elevated serum miR-223 levels in mice, no significant
  alterations in miR-223 serum levels were found in mice after CLP-induced
  sepsis. In accordance with these results from animal models, serum miR-223
  levels did not differ between critically ill patients and healthy controls.
  However, ICU patients with more severe disease (APACHE-II score) showed
  moderately reduced circulating miR-223. Strikingly, no differences in miR-223
  levels were found in critically ill patients with or without sepsis, and
  serum levels of miR-223 did not correlate with classical markers of
  inflammation or bacterial infection. Finally, low miR-223 serum levels were
  moderately associated with an unfavorable prognosis of patients during the
  ICU treatment but did not predict long-term mortality. CONCLUSION: Recent
  reports on alterations in miR-223 serum levels during sepsis revealed
  contradictory results, preventing a potential use of this miRNA in clinical
  routine. We clearly show that miR-223 serum levels do not reflect the
  presence of sepsis neither in mouse models nor in a large cohort of ICU
  patients and do not indicate clinical outcome of critically ill patients.
  Thus miR-223 serum levels should not be used as a biomarker in this setting.%

    BACKGROUND: In patients with sepsis the production of arachidonic acid
  metabolites by cyclooxygenase increases, but the pathophysiologic role of
  these prostaglandins is unclear. In animal models, inhibition of
  cyclooxygenase by treatment with ibuprofen before the onset of sepsis reduces
  physiologic abnormalities and improves survival. In pilot studies of patients
  with sepsis, treatment with ibuprofen led to improvements in gas exchange and
  airway mechanics. METHODS: From October 1989 to March 1995, we conducted a
  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ibuprofen
  (10 mg per kilogram of body weight [maximal dose, 800 mg], given every six
  hours for eight doses) in 455 patients who had sepsis, defined as fever,
  tachycardia, tachypnea, and acute failure of at least one organ system.
  RESULTS: In the ibuprofen group, but not the placebo group, there were
  significant declines in urinary levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane,
  temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis. With
  ibuprofen therapy there was no increased incidence of renal dysfunction,
  gastrointestinal bleeding, or other adverse events. However, treatment with
  ibuprofen did not reduce the incidence or duration of shock or the acute
  respiratory distress syndrome and did not significantly improve the rate of
  survival at 30 days (mortality, 37 percent with ibuprofen vs 40 percent with
  placebo). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, treatment with ibuprofen
  reduces levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane and decreases fever,
  tachycardia, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis, but it does not prevent
  the development of shock or the acute respiratory distress syndrome and does
  not improve survival.%

    Following their discovery in the early 1970s, classical human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) loci have been the prototypical candidates for genetic
  susceptibility to infectious disease. Indeed, the original hypothesis for the
  extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major
  selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome
  and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in
  greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that
  determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at
  the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to
  infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and
  discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will
  potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious
  diseases in the future.%

    Thousands of pathogens are known to infect humans, but only a fraction are
  readily identifiable using current diagnostic methods. Microbial cell-free
  DNA sequencing offers the potential to non-invasively identify a wide range
  of infections throughout the body, but the challenges of clinical-grade
  metagenomic testing must be addressed. Here we describe the analytical and
  clinical validation of a next-generation sequencing test that identifies and
  quantifies microbial cell-free DNA in plasma from 1,250 clinically relevant
  bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and eukaryotic parasites. Test accuracy,
  precision, bias and robustness to a number of metagenomics-specific
  challenges were determined using a panel of 13 microorganisms that model key
  determinants of performance in 358 contrived plasma samples, as well as 2,625
  infections simulated in silico and 580 clinical study samples. The test
  showed 93.7% agreement with blood culture in a cohort of 350 patients with a
  sepsis alert and identified an independently adjudicated cause of the sepsis
  alert more often than all of the microbiological testing combined (169
  aetiological determinations versus 132). Among the 166 samples adjudicated to
  have no sepsis aetiology identified by any of the tested methods, sequencing
  identified microbial cell-free DNA in 62, likely derived from commensal
  organisms and incidental findings unrelated to the sepsis alert. Analysis of
  the first 2,000 patient samples tested in the CLIA laboratory showed that
  more than 85% of results were delivered the day after sample receipt, with
  53.7% of reports identifying one or more microorganisms.%

    INTRODUCTION: The Tie2/angiopoietin (Tie2/Ang) and vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor-ligand systems (VEGFR/VEGF) are recognized to play
  important roles in the regulation of microvascular endothelial function.
  Downregulation of these genes during sepsis has been implicated in the
  pathogenesis of sepsis-related microvascular leak and multiple organ
  dysfunction syndrome. Mechanisms responsible for dysregulation of angiogenic
  genes in sepsis are poorly defined. METHODS: Western blot, reverse
  transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and multiplex chromatin
  immunoprecipitation platform (Matrix ChIP) were used to investigate serum
  albumin leak, changes in gene expression, and associated epigenetic
  alterations in a murine model of acute lung injury-induced sepsis
  (ALI-sepsis). RESULTS: Experimental ALI-sepsis induced microvascular leak and
  downregulation of expression of Angpt1 (Ang1), Tek (Tie2), and Kdr (Vegfr2 or
  Flk-1) genes in the lung, kidney, and liver. These changes correlate with a
  decrease in RNA polymerase II density at these genes, and the greatest
  response was observed in the lung. ALI-sepsis reduced levels of
  transcription-permissive histone H3 lysine acetylation (H3KAc) at these loci
  in all examined tissues. Decreases in permissive H3K4m3 and H3Km2 marks were
  detected only in the lung. In contrast, only minimal alterations in
  transcription-repressive histone modifications (H3K27m3, H3K9m2, H3K9m3, and
  H4K20m3) were observed in all tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate
  that decreases in transcription-permissive, but not increases in
  transcription-repressive, histone modifications at Angpt1, Tek, and Kdr are a
  systemic, rather than a lung-restricted, response, involving key end-organs
  in experimental ALI-sepsis. Given that ventilator-associated pneumonia is a
  major cause of sepsis in critically ill patients, elucidation of mechanisms
  mediating epigenetic alterations during sepsis provides fundamental new
  insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced microvascular leak and
  subsequent end-organ injury/dysfunction.%

    CONTEXT: Severe sepsis is typically characterized by initial
  cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation. Whether this hyperinflammatory phase is
  followed by immunosuppression is controversial. Animal studies suggest that
  multiple immune defects occur in sepsis, but data from humans remain
  conflicting. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of sepsis with changes
  in host innate and adaptive immunity and to examine potential mechanisms for
  putative immunosuppression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Rapid
  postmortem spleen and lung tissue harvest was performed at the bedsides of 40
  patients who died in intensive care units (ICUs) of academic medical centers
  with active severe sepsis to characterize their immune status at the time of
  death (2009-2011). Control spleens (n = 29) were obtained from patients who
  were declared brain-dead or had emergent splenectomy due to trauma; control
  lungs (n = 20) were obtained from transplant donors or from lung cancer
  resections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytokine secretion assays and
  immunophenotyping of cell surface receptor-ligand expression profiles were
  performed to identify potential mechanisms of immune dysfunction.
  Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the loss of immune
  effector cells. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients with sepsis and controls
  were 71.7 (SD, 15.9) and 52.7 (SD, 15.0) years, respectively. The median
  number of ICU days for patients with sepsis was 8 (range, 1-195 days), while
  control patients were in ICUs for 4 or fewer days. The median duration of
  sepsis was 4 days (range, 1-40 days). Compared with controls,
  anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes from sepsis patients had
  significant reductions in cytokine secretion at 5 hours: tumor necrosis
  factor, 5361 (95% CI, 3327-7485) pg/mL vs 418 (95% CI, 98-738) pg/mL;
  interferon gamma, 1374 (95% CI, 550-2197) pg/mL vs 37.5 (95% CI, -5 to 80)
  pg/mL; interleukin 6, 3691 (95% CI, 2313-5070) vs 365 (95% CI, 87-642) pg/mL;
  and interleukin 10, 633 (95% CI, -269 to 1534) vs 58 (95% CI, -39 to 156)
  pg/mL; (P < .001 for all). There were similar reductions in 5-hour
  lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion. Cytokine secretion in
  sepsis patients was generally less than 10% that in controls, independent of
  age, duration of sepsis, corticosteroid use, and nutritional status. Although
  differences existed between spleen and lung, flow cytometric analysis showed
  increased expression of selected inhibitory receptors and ligands and
  expansion of suppressor cell populations in both organs. Unique differences
  in cellular inhibitory molecule expression existed in immune cells isolated
  from lungs of sepsis patients vs cancer patients and vs transplant donors.
  Immunohistochemical staining showed extensive depletion of splenic CD4, CD8,
  and HLA-DR cells and expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on lung
  epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who die in the ICU following sepsis
  compared with patients who die of nonsepsis etiologies have biochemical, flow
  cytometric, and immunohistochemical findings consistent with
  immunosuppression. Targeted immune-enhancing therapy may be a valid approach
  in selected patients with sepsis.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Insensitivity and technical complexity have impeded the implementation of
  high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing in differential diagnosis of viral
  infections in clinical laboratories. Here, we describe the development of a
  virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT)
  that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and
  characterization. The system uses ~2 million probes that cover the genomes of
  members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans.
  A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen
  cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic
  acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and
  host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100- to
  10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates
  compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus
  enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and
  RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable
  to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts.
  Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were
  approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing
  the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses
  of virome composition and dynamics. IMPORTANCE : VirCapSeq-VERT enables
  detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those
  found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly
  multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification
  and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate
  viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational
  simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate
  transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as
  research applications.%

    BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is an experimentally
  neglected severe disease with a substantial burden on human health. Because
  of technical limitations, little is known about the biology of this important
  human pathogen. Whole genome analysis methods on patient-derived material are
  thus likely to have a substantial impact on our understanding of P. vivax
  pathogenesis and epidemiology. For example, it will allow study of the
  evolution and population biology of the parasite, allow parasite transmission
  patterns to be characterized, and may facilitate the identification of new
  drug resistance genes. Because parasitemias are typically low and the
  parasite cannot be readily cultured, on-site leukocyte depletion of blood
  samples is typically needed to remove human DNA that may be 1000X more
  abundant than parasite DNA. These features have precluded the analysis of
  archived blood samples and require the presence of laboratories in close
  proximity to the collection of field samples for optimal pre-cryopreservation
  sample preparation. RESULTS: Here we show that in-solution hybridization
  capture can be used to extract P. vivax DNA from human contaminating DNA in
  the laboratory without the need for on-site leukocyte filtration. Using a
  whole genome capture method, we were able to enrich P. vivax DNA from bulk
  genomic DNA from less than 0.5% to a median of 55% (range 20%-80%). This
  level of enrichment allows for efficient analysis of the samples by whole
  genome sequencing and does not introduce any gross biases into the data. With
  this method, we obtained greater than 5X coverage across 93% of the P. vivax
  genome for four P. vivax strains from Iquitos, Peru, which is similar to our
  results using leukocyte filtration (greater than 5X coverage across 96% ).
  CONCLUSION: The whole genome capture technique will enable more efficient
  whole genome analysis of P. vivax from a larger geographic region and from
  valuable archived sample collections.%

    Sepsis is a state of disrupted inflammatory homeostasis that is often
  initiated by infection. The development and progression of sepsis is
  multi-factorial, and affects the cardiovascular, immunological and endocrine
  systems of the body. The complexity of sepsis makes the clinical study of
  sepsis and sepsis therapeutics difficult. Animal models have been developed
  in an effort to create reproducible systems for studying sepsis pathogenesis
  and preliminary testing of potential therapeutic agents. However,
  demonstrated benefit from a therapeutic agent in animal models has rarely
  been translated into success in human clinical trials. This review summarizes
  the common animal sepsis models and highlights how results of recent human
  clinical trials might affect their use.%

    A selective advantage against infectious disease associated with increased
  heterozygosity at the human major histocompatibility complex [human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) class I and class II] is believed to play a major role in
  maintaining the extraordinary allelic diversity of these genes. Maximum HLA
  heterozygosity of class I loci (A, B, and C) delayed acquired
  immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) onset among patients infected with human
  immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), whereas individuals who were
  homozygous for one or more loci progressed rapidly to AIDS and death. The HLA
  class I alleles B*35 and Cw*04 were consistently associated with rapid
  development of AIDS-defining conditions in Caucasians. The extended survival
  of 28 to 40 percent of HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients who avoided AIDS for
  ten or more years can be attributed to their being fully heterozygous at HLA
  class I loci, to their lacking the AIDS-associated alleles B*35 and Cw*04, or
  to both.%

    The gold standard for clinical diagnosis of bacterial lower respiratory
  infections (LRIs) is culture, which has poor sensitivity and is too slow to
  guide early, targeted antimicrobial therapy. Metagenomic sequencing could
  identify LRI pathogens much faster than culture, but methods are needed to
  remove the large amount of human DNA present in these samples for this
  approach to be feasible. We developed a metagenomics method for bacterial LRI
  diagnosis that features efficient saponin-based host DNA depletion and
  nanopore sequencing. Our pilot method was tested on 40 samples, then
  optimized and tested on a further 41 samples. Our optimized method (6 h from
  sample to result) was 96.6% sensitive and 41.7% specific for pathogen
  detection compared with culture and we could accurately detect antibiotic
  resistance genes. After confirmatory quantitative PCR and pathobiont-specific
  gene analyses, specificity and sensitivity increased to 100%. Nanopore
  metagenomics can rapidly and accurately characterize bacterial LRIs and might
  contribute to a reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic use.%

    STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the microbiological spectra, patient
  outcome, and prognostic factors of pulmonary fungal infection. DESIGN: The
  medical and microbiological records of patients with pulmonary fungal
  infection were retrospectively analyzed. SETTING: A university-affiliated
  tertiary medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1988 to December
  1997, all cases of pulmonary fungal infection were reviewed. The criteria for
  inclusion were obvious lung lesion shown on chest radiographs and one of the
  following: (1) the presence of fungi in or isolation of fungi from the biopsy
  specimen of open thoracotomy, thoracoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy, or
  ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration/biopsy; or (2) isolation of
  fungi from pleural effusion or blood, with no evidence of extrapulmonary
  infection. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included. Ninety-four cases
  of pulmonary fungal infection (67%) were community acquired. The most
  frequently encountered fungi were Aspergillus species (57%), followed by
  Cryptococcus species (21%) and Candida species (14%). There were 72 patients
  with acute invasive fungal infection, with a mortality rate of 67%.
  Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that nosocomial infection (p
  = 0.014) and respiratory failure (p = 0.001) were significantly and
  independently associated with death of acute invasive fungal infection.
  CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary fungal infection of community-acquired origins is
  becoming a serious problem. It should be taken into consideration for
  differential diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, acute
  invasive fungal infection is associated with a much higher mortality rate for
  patients with nosocomial infection or complicating respiratory failure. Early
  diagnosis with prompt antifungal therapy, or even with surgical intervention,
  might be warranted to save patients' lives.%

    The acute phase of sepsis is characterized by a strong inflammatory
  reaction. At later stages in some patients, immunoparalysis may be
  encountered, which is associated with a poor outcome. By transcriptional and
  metabolic profiling of human patients with sepsis, we found that a shift from
  oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis was an important component of
  initial activation of host defense. Blocking metabolic pathways with
  metformin diminished cytokine production and increased mortality in systemic
  fungal infection in mice. In contrast, in leukocytes rendered tolerant by
  exposure to lipopolysaccharide or after isolation from patients with sepsis
  and immunoparalysis, a generalized metabolic defect at the level of both
  glycolysis and oxidative metabolism was apparent, which was restored after
  recovery of the patients. Finally, the immunometabolic defects in humans were
  partially restored by therapy with recombinant interferon-gamma, which
  suggested that metabolic processes might represent a therapeutic target in
  sepsis.%

    RATIONALE: The role of viruses in pneumonia in adults and the impact of
  viral infection on mortality have not been elucidated. Previous studies have
  significant limitations in that they relied predominantly on upper
  respiratory specimens. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of viral infection
  in adult patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU)
  admission. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort was
  conducted in a 28-bed medical ICU. Patients with severe community-acquired
  pneumonia (CAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) were included in
  the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 198 patients (64 with
  CAP, 134 with HCAP) were included for analysis. Of these, 115 patients
  (58.1%) underwent bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 104 of whom
  were tested for respiratory viruses by BAL fluid reverse-transcription
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nasopharyngeal specimen RT-PCR was
  performed in 159 patients (84.1%). Seventy-one patients (35.9%) had a
  bacterial infection, and 72 patients (36.4%) had a viral infection.
  Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (23.6%), followed by
  parainfluenza virus (20.8%), human metapneumovirus (18.1%), influenza virus
  (16.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (13.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus
  was significantly more common in the CAP group (CAP, 10.9%; HCAP, 2.2%; P =
  0.01). The mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral
  infections, and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different
  (25.5, 26.5, and 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are
  frequently found in the airway of patients with pneumonia requiring ICU
  admission and may cause severe forms of pneumonia. Patients with viral
  infection and bacterial infection had comparable mortality rates.%

    OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies demonstrate that inherited factors play
  a major role in the development and prognosis of sepsis. However, genetic
  association studies in sepsis have produced contradictory evidence of an
  effect from individual polymorphisms. Major methodological flaws have been
  reported in a number of genetic association studies in non-septic
  populations, relating to problems with experimental design, statistical
  analysis, study size, power and replication. We hypothesised that genetic
  association studies investigating sepsis suffer from similar problems, and
  that this explains the lack of consistent evidence for an effect from
  polymorphisms. DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted of published genetic
  association studies in sepsis from 1996-2005 using a newly devised scoring
  system for study quality and rigour. A Bayesian statistical analysis was also
  carried out to assess the false-positive report probability of identified
  studies. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Study quality was assessed using a
  10-point scoring system designed from published reporting guidelines. The
  majority of studies were of low to intermediate quality, with deficiencies in
  control group selection, genetic assay technique, study blinding, statistical
  interpretation, study replication, study size and power. Bayesian analysis
  indicated that many of the studies reporting a positive association between a
  genetic polymorphism and sepsis were likely to represent false-positive
  associations. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and size of genetic association
  studies in septic patients needs to improve if advances in identifying
  genetic effects in sepsis are to occur. Investigators should, as a minimum,
  follow recommended guidelines when designing studies.%

    OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of BAY x 1351, a murine
  monoclonal antibody to recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,
  in patients with sepsis. DESIGN: An international, multicenter, prospective,
  placebo-controlled trial in patients with sepsis, stratified into
  shock/nonshock groups. SETTING: Forty acute clinical care facilities in 14
  countries. PATIENTS: Of the 564 patients enrolled in the study, 553 patients
  received study drug or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 15 mg/kg or
  3 mg/kg of BAY x 1351, or placebo, as a single intravenous infusion.
  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were well matched for severity of
  illness and for risk factors known to influence the outcome of sepsis. There
  was no difference in 28-day mortality rates between groups (placebo group 66
  [39.5%] of 167;3 mg/kg group 57 [31.5%] of 181; 15 mg/kg group 87 [42.4%] of
  205). Approximately 9 months after this study had begun, an interim safety
  examination of NORASEPT, a North American Sepsis Trial using the same
  monoclonal antibody, indicated that there was no benefit to patients in the
  nonshock group and further enrollment of these nonshock septic patients into
  INTERSEPT was stopped. The analysis therefore focused on the 420 patients in
  shock. The primary efficacy variable was the 28-day, all-cause mortality
  rate: placebo group 57 (42.9%) of 133; 3-mg/kg group 51 (36.7%) of 139; and
  15-mg/kg group 66 (44.6%) of 148 (not significant). Two secondary efficacy
  variables were identified prospectively: shock reversal and frequency of
  organ failures. Life-table analysis showed that in patients who survived 28
  days, there was a more rapid reversal of shock in both treatment groups
  compared with placebo (15-mg/kg group vs. placebo group log-rank statistic p
  = .007, 3-mg/kg group vs. placebo group p = .01). Similarly, in patients
  surviving 28 days, there was a significant delay in the time to the onset of
  first organ failure (log rank 15 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .03, 3 mg/kg vs.
  placebo p = .07), and more patients in the placebo group developed at least
  one organ failure: 15-mg/kg group 33 (40.2%) of 82; 3-mg/kg group 39 (44.3%)
  of 88; and placebo group 45 (59.2%) of 76 (15 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .03, 3
  mg/kg vs. placebo p = .06). No significant adverse events were associated
  with the monoclonal antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: INTERSEPT provides
  additional clinical data implicating TNF-alpha as an integral mediator of
  septic shock. The study suggested a possible role for anti-TNF antibody as
  adjunctive therapy, but this possibility requires confirmation by another
  clinical trial.%

    The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BARF1 gene encodes a soluble
  colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor that neutralizes the effects of
  CSF-1 in vitro. To study the effect of BARF1 on EBV-induced transformation,
  we added recombinant BARF1 to B cells in the presence of EBV. BARF1 did not
  enhance transformation of B cells by EBV in vitro. To study the role of BARF1
  in the context of EBV infection, we constructed a recombinant EBV mutant with
  a large deletion followed by stop codons in the BARF1 gene as well as a
  recombinant virus with a wild-type BARF1 gene. While BARF1 has previously
  been shown to act as an oncogene in several cell lines, the EBV BARF1
  deletion mutant transformed B cells and initiated latent infection, and the B
  cells transformed with the BARF1 mutant virus induced tumors in SCID mice
  with an efficiency similar to that of the wild-type recombinant virus. Since
  human CSF-1 stimulates secretion of alpha interferon from mononuclear cells
  and BARF1 encodes a soluble CSF-1 receptor, we examined whether recombinant
  BARF1 or BARF1 derived from EBV-infected B cells could inhibit alpha
  interferon secretion. Recombinant BARF1 inhibited alpha interferon secretion
  by mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The B cells transformed
  with mutant BARF1 EBV showed reduced inhibition of alpha interferon secretion
  by human mononuclear cells when compared with the B cells transformed with
  wild-type recombinant virus. These experiments indicate that BARF1 expressed
  from the EBV genome directly inhibits alpha interferon secretion, which may
  modulate the innate host response to the virus.%

    The Gene Ontology resource (GO; http://geneontology.org) provides

  quality. Here, we report the major developments of the GO resource during the
  past two years. Each monthly release of the GO resource is now packaged and
  given a unique identifier (DOI), enabling GO-based analyses on a specific
  release to be reproduced in the future. The molecular function ontology has
  been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products,
  with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts
  have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate
  annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable
  users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new
  framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than
  standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the
  growing repository of these models. We also provide the 'GO ribbon' widget
  for visualizing GO annotations to a gene; the widget can be easily embedded

    Importance: Latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is present in more than
  half the adult population, and a viral reactivation (ie, when the virus
  becomes measurable in body fluids such as blood) can occur in up to one-third
  of these individuals during episodes of critical illness. Objective: To
  determine whether antiviral therapy is safe and effective for preventing CMV
  reactivation in a general population of critically ill patients. Design,
  Setting, and Participants: A single-center, open-label, randomized,
  controlled clinical trial recruited 124 CMV-seropositive patients undergoing
  mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours in the intensive care unit
  between January 1, 2012, and January 31, 2014. The mean baseline Acute
  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of all patients was 17.6.
  Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive anti-CMV prophylaxis with
  valacyclovir hydrochloride (n = 34) or low-dose valganciclovir hydrochloride
  (n = 46) for up to 28 days to suppress viral reactivation, or to a control
  group with no intervention (n = 44). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to
  first CMV reactivation in blood within the 28-day follow-up period following
  initiation of the study drug. Results: Among the 124 patients in the study
  (46 women and 78 men; mean [SD] age, 56.9 [16.9] years), viral reactivation
  in the blood occurred in 12 patients in the control group, compared with 1
  patient in the valganciclovir group and 2 patients in the valacyclovir group
  (combined treatment groups vs control: hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% CI 0.04-0.50).
  Although this trial was not powered to assess clinical end points, the
  valacyclovir arm was halted prematurely because of higher mortality; 14 of 34
  patients (41.2%) had died by 28 days, compared with 5 of 37 (13.5%) patients
  in the control arm at the point of the decision to halt this arm. Other
  safety end points showed similar outcomes between groups. Conclusions and
  Relevance: Antiviral prophylaxis with valacyclovir or low-dose valganciclovir
  suppresses CMV reactivation in patients with critical illness. However, given
  the higher mortality, a large-scale trial would be needed to determine the
  clinical efficacy and safety of CMV suppression. Trial Registration:
  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01503918.%

    INTRODUCTION: Severe sepsis is associated with high levels of morbidity and
  mortality, placing a high burden on healthcare resources. We aimed to study
  outcomes in the five years after severe sepsis. METHODS: This was a cohort
  study using data from a prospective audit in 26 adult ICUs in Scotland.
  Mortality was measured using clinical databases and quality of life using
  Short Form 36 (SF-36) at 3.5 and 5 years after severe sepsis. RESULTS: A
  total of 439 patients were recruited with a 58% mortality at 3.5 years and
  61% mortality at 5 years. A total of 85 and 67 patients responded at 3.5 and
  5 years follow-up, respectively. SF-36 physical component score (PCS) was low
  compared to population controls at 3.5 years (mean 41.8 (SD 11.8)) and at 5
  years (mean 44.8 (SD 12.7)). SF-36 mental component score (MCS) was slightly
  lower than population controls at 3.5 years (mean 47.7 (SD 14.6)) and at 5
  years after severe sepsis (mean 48.8 (SD 12.6)). The majority of patients
  were satisfied with their current quality of life (QOL) (80%) and all
  patients would be willing to be treated in an ICU again if they become
  critically ill despite many having unpleasant memories (19%) and recall (29%)
  of ICU events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe sepsis have a high ongoing
  mortality after severe sepsis. They also have a significantly lower physical
  QOL compared to population norms but mental QOL scores were only slightly
  below population norms up to five years after severe sepsis. All survivors
  would be willing to be treated in an ICU again if critically ill. Mortality
  and QOL outcomes were broadly similar to other critically ill cohorts
  throughout the five years of follow-up.%

    BACKGROUND: Effective targeted therapy for sepsis requires an understanding
  of the heterogeneity in the individual host response to infection. We
  investigated this heterogeneity by defining interindividual variation in the
  transcriptome of patients with sepsis and related this to outcome and genetic
  diversity. METHODS: We assayed peripheral blood leucocyte global gene
  expression for a prospective discovery cohort of 265 adult patients admitted
  to UK intensive care units with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia
  and evidence of organ dysfunction. We then validated our findings in a
  replication cohort consisting of a further 106 patients. We mapped genomic
  determinants of variation in gene transcription between patients as
  expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). FINDINGS: We discovered that
  following admission to intensive care, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral
  blood leucocytes defines two distinct sepsis response signatures (SRS1 and
  SRS2). The presence of SRS1 (detected in 108 [41%] patients in discovery
  cohort) identifies individuals with an immunosuppressed phenotype that
  included features of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell exhaustion, and
  downregulation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II. SRS1 was associated
  with higher 14 day mortality than was SRS2 (discovery cohort hazard ratio
  (HR) 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5, p=0.005; validation cohort HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.1,
  p=0.0007). We found that a predictive set of seven genes enabled the
  classification of patients as SRS1 or SRS2. We identified cis-acting and
  trans-acting eQTL for key immune and metabolic response genes and sepsis
  response networks. Sepsis eQTL were enriched in endotoxin-induced epigenetic
  marks and modulated the individual host response to sepsis, including effects
  specific to SRS group. We identified regulatory genetic variants involving
  key mediators of gene networks implicated in the hypoxic response and the
  switch to glycolysis that occurs in sepsis, including HIF1alpha and mTOR, and
  mediators of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell activation, and viral defence.
  INTERPRETATION: Our integrated genomics approach advances understanding of
  heterogeneity in sepsis by defining subgroups of patients with different
  immune response states and prognoses, as well as revealing the role of
  underlying genetic variation. Our findings provide new insights into the
  pathogenesis of sepsis and create opportunities for a precision medicine
  approach to enable targeted therapeutic intervention to improve sepsis
  outcomes. FUNDING: European Commission, Medical Research Council (UK), and
  the Wellcome Trust.%

    BACKGROUND: Most studies about septic shock report a crude mortality rate
  that neither distinguishes between early and late deaths nor addresses the
  direct causes of death. We herein aimed to determine the modalities of death
  in septic shock. METHODS: This was a 6-year (2008-2013) monocenter
  retrospective study. All consecutive patients diagnosed for septic shock
  within the first 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included.
  Early and late deaths were defined as occurring within or after 3 days
  following ICU admission, respectively. The main cause of death in the ICU was
  determined from medical files. A multinomial logistic regression analysis
  using the status alive as the reference category was performed to identify
  the prognostic factors associated with early and late deaths. RESULTS: Five
  hundred forty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 66 +/- 15
  years and a high proportion (67 %) of comorbidities. The in-ICU and
  in-hospital mortality rates were 37.2 and 45 %, respectively. Deaths occurred
  early for 78 (32 %) and later on for 166 (68 %) patients in the ICU (n = 124)
  or in the hospital (n = 42). Early deaths were mainly attributable to
  intractable multiple organ failure related to the primary infection (82 %)
  and to mesenteric ischemia (6.4 %). In-ICU late deaths were directly related
  to end-of-life decisions in 29 % of patients and otherwise mostly related to
  ICU-acquired complications, including nosocomial infections (20.4 %) and
  mesenteric ischemia (16.6 %). Independent determinants of early death were
  age, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, no pathogen identification, and initial
  severity. Among 3-day survivors, independent risk factors for late death were
  age, cirrhosis, no pathogen identification, and previous corticosteroid
  treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of
  septic shock-related deaths. Identification of risk factors of early and late
  deaths may determine differential prognostic patterns.%

    The central role of the microbiome in critical illness is supported by a
  half century of experimental and clinical study. The physiological effects of
  critical illness and the clinical interventions of intensive care
  substantially alter the microbiome. In turn, the microbiome predicts
  patients' susceptibility to disease, and manipulation of the microbiome has
  prevented or modulated critical illness in animal models and clinical trials.
  This Review surveys the microbial ecology of critically ill patients,
  presents the facts and unanswered questions surrounding gut-derived sepsis,
  and explores the radically altered ecosystem of the injured alveolus. The
  revolution in culture-independent microbiology has provided the tools needed
  to target the microbiome rationally for the prevention and treatment of
  critical illness, holding great promise to improve the acute and chronic
  outcomes of the critically ill.%

    Injured patients with lung contusion (LC) are at risk of developing
  bacterial pneumonia (PNA) followed by sepsis and death. A recent genome-wide
  association study (GWAS) showed FER gene expression positively correlating
  with survival rates among individuals with above conditions. We sought to
  determine whether electroporation (EP)-mediated delivery of FER gene could
  indeed improve survival, in a lethal model of combined LC and PNA. C57BL/6
  mice sustained unilateral LC, which preceded a 500 Klebsiella colony forming
  unit (CFU) inoculation by 6 h. In-between these insults, human FER plasmid
  (pFER) was introduced into the lungs followed by eight EP pulses applied
  externally (10 ms at 200 V cm(-1)). Control groups included EP of empty
  vector (pcDNA3) or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase genes (pPump) and no treatment (LC+PNA).
  We recorded survival, histology, lung mechanics, bronchial alveolar lavage
  (BAL) fluid, FER and inflammatory gene expression and bacteriology. The data
  show that 7-day survival was significantly improved by pFER compared with
  control groups. pFER increased BAL monocytes and activated antibacterial
  response genes (nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Fizz). pFER treatment showed
  decreased lung and blood Klebsiella counts reaching, in some cases, complete
  sterilization. In conclusion, FER gene delivery promoted survival in LC+PNA
  mice via recruitment of activated immune cells, improving efficiency of
  bacterial clearance within contused lung.%

    MOTIVATION: Over the last few years, methods based on suffix arrays using
  the Burrows-Wheeler Transform have been widely used for DNA sequence read
  matching and assembly. These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in
  the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the
  dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data
  has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on
  probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the
  reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient.
  Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed,
  which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by
  genotype algorithms. RESULTS: Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable
  sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on
  positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional
  Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with
  run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using
  gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all
  maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than O(NM(2))
  as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm,
  empirically independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find
  maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes
  some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and
  phasing.%

    To systematically investigate the impact of immune stimulation upon
  regulatory variant activity, we exposed primary monocytes from 432 healthy
  Europeans to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or differing durations of
  lipopolysaccharide and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).
  More than half of cis-eQTLs identified, involving hundreds of genes and
  associated pathways, are detected specifically in stimulated monocytes.
  Induced innate immune activity reveals multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs
  including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), coding variants
  altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-beta cytokine network showing
  temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2)
  transcription factor-modulated network. Induced eQTL are significantly
  enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying context-specific
  associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and IRF8. Thus,
  applying pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli assists resolution of
  functional genetic variants.%

    Background: The influenza A H1N1/09 pandemic infected a small number of
  exposed individuals, which suggests the involvement of genetic factors. There
  are scarce data available on classical HLA class I association with the
  influenza A H1N1/09 pandemic. Methods: We analyzed the frequency of classical
  HLA class I alleles and haplotypes in A H1N1/09 influenza in a case-control
  study including 138 influenza patients (INF-P) and 225 asymptomatic healthy
  contacts (INF-C) simultaneously recruited. HLA class I typing was performed
  by high-resolution sequence-based typing method. Results: Our analysis
  revealed higher frequency of C *07:02:01, B *39:06:02, C *03:02:01, B
  *44:03:01, B *51:01:05, and B *73:01 (p < 0.05; OR = 1.84-9.98) and of two
  haplotypes-A *68:01:02-C *07:02:01 (p = 1.05E - 05; OR = 23.99) and B
  *35:01:01-C *07:02.01 (p = 4.15E - 04, OR = 2.15)-in A H1N1/09 influenza
  subjects. A *68:01:01 was exclusively present only in the INF-P group
  (5/138). A decrease in the frequency of C *03:03:01, A *11:01:01, B
  *39:01:01, A *24:02:01, C *03:04:01, B *51:01:01, and C *07:01:01 (p < 0.05;
  OR = 0.12-0.52) and of haplotypes A *02:01:01-B *35:01:01-C *04:01:01, A
  *24:02:01-B *35:01:01, B *39:01:01-C *07:02:01, and B *40:02:01-C *03:04:01
  (p < 0.05; OR = 0.08-0.22) were observed in INF-P group. Conclusion:
  Selective classical HLA class I allele and haplotype combinations predispose
  individuals towards susceptibility or protection against the influenza A
  H1N1/09 pandemic. This work has significant implications for accessing
  population transmission risk for A H1N1/09 or a similar strain breakout in
  the future.%

    BACKGROUND: Biological interpretation of genomic summary data such as those
  resulting from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression
  quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies is one of the major bottlenecks in
  medical genomics research, calling for efficient and integrative tools to
  resolve this problem. RESULTS: We introduce eXploring Genomic Relations
  (XGR), an open source tool designed for enhanced interpretation of genomic
  summary data enabling downstream knowledge discovery. Targeting users of
  varying computational skills, XGR utilises prior biological knowledge and
  relationships in a highly integrated but easily accessible way to make
  user-input genomic summary datasets more interpretable. We show how by
  incorporating ontology, annotation, and systems biology network-driven
  approaches, XGR generates more informative results than conventional
  analyses. We apply XGR to GWAS and eQTL summary data to explore the genomic
  landscape of the activated innate immune response and common immunological
  diseases. We provide genomic evidence for a disease taxonomy supporting the
  concept of a disease spectrum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory disorders.
  We also show how XGR can define SNP-modulated gene networks and pathways that
  are shared and distinct between diseases, how it achieves functional,
  phenotypic and epigenomic annotations of genes and variants, and how it
  enables exploring annotation-based relationships between genetic variants.
  CONCLUSIONS: XGR provides a single integrated solution to enhance
  interpretation of genomic summary data for downstream biological discovery.
  XGR is released as both an R package and a web-app, freely available at
  http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/XGR .%

    Sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria and that caused by gram-positive
  bacteria often manifest similar clinical features. We investigated plasma
  proinflammatory cytokine profiles in patients with sepsis due to
  gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and studied the cytokine production
  and differential gene regulation of leukocytes stimulated ex vivo with
  Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus.
  Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 receptor
  antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 binding protein, procalcitonin, and
  protein C in plasma did not differ between patients with sepsis due to
  gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. However, plasma IL-1beta, IL-6, and
  IL-18 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with sepsis due to
  gram-positive bacteria. Ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with heat-killed
  S. aureus markedly increased IL-1beta and IL-18 levels more than E. coli
  lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Microarray analysis revealed at least 359
  cross-validated probe sets (genes) significant at the P < 0.001 level whose
  expression discriminated among gram-negative-organism-stimulated,
  gram-positive-organism-stimulated, and unstimulated whole-blood leukocytes.
  The host inflammatory responses to gram-negative and gram-positive stimuli
  share some common response elements but also exhibit distinct patterns of
  cytokine appearance and leukocyte gene expression.%

    Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that
  typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature
  suggestive of an infectious origin. We studied MCC samples by digital
  transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a
  previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine
  phosphatase. Further investigation led to identification and sequence
  analysis of the 5387-base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus
  that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV). MCV sequences were
  detected in 8 of 10 (80%) MCC tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues
  from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. In six of
  eight MCV-positive MCCs, viral DNA was integrated within the tumor genome in
  a clonal pattern, suggesting that MCV infection and integration preceded
  clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Thus, MCV may be a contributing factor
  in the pathogenesis of MCC.%

    Clinical metagenomics (CMg) is the discipline that refers to the sequencing
  of all nucleic acid material present within a clinical specimen with the
  intent to recover clinically relevant microbial information. From a
  diagnostic perspective, next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers the ability
  to rapidly identify putative pathogens and predict their antimicrobial
  resistance profiles to optimize targeted treatment regimens. Since the
  introduction of metagenomics nearly a decade ago, numerous reports have
  described successful applications in an increasing variety of biological
  specimens, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, blood
  and tissue. Considerable advancements in sequencing and computational
  technologies in recent years have made CMg a promising tool in clinical
  microbiology laboratories. Moreover, costs per sample and turnaround time
  from specimen receipt to clinical management continue to decrease, making the
  prospect of CMg more feasible. Many difficulties, however, are associated
  with CMg and warrant further improvements such as the informatics
  infrastructure and analytical pipelines. Thus, the current review focuses on
  comprehensively assessing applications of CMg for diagnostic and subtyping
  purposes.%

    BACKGROUND: Though basigin (BSG) was reported to be overexpressed in
  nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and correlate with the development of NPC, the
  molecular basis of BSG in NPC remained elusive. The aim of the research was
  to investigate BSG expression in NPC and the potential molecular mechanism
  underlying it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BSG expression in NPC tissues was
  detected with immunohistochemistry. Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test and
  Spearman correlation test were performed to examine the relationship between
  BSG expression and the clinico-pathological features as well as EGFR and P-53
  expression in NPC. In addition, data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)
  database and oncomine were collected to validate BSG expression in NPC.
  Meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between BSG
  expression and the clinico-pathological variables of NPC. The prognostic
  value and the alteration of BSG gene status were also analyzed with data from
  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: BSG presented notably higher
  expression in NPC tissues than in non-cancer tissues. Moreover, IHC results
  showed that BSG expression was significantly correlated with tumor
  progression. A positive correlation was also found between BSG expression and
  EGFR, P53 expression. Meta-analysis confirmed that BSG was indicative of
  lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in NPC. Additionally, data from
  cBioPortal indicated that alteration of BSG gene existed in 5% of NPC cases
  and BSG correlative genes were obtained from the Co-expression Analysis in
  TCGA. CONCLUSION: BSG was overexpressed in NPC and might have an oncogenic
  effect on the tumorigenesis and progression of NPC.%

    Targeting genomic loci by massively parallel sequencing requires new
  methods to enrich templates to be sequenced. We developed a capture method
  that uses biotinylated RNA 'baits' to fish targets out of a 'pond' of DNA
  fragments. The RNA is transcribed from PCR-amplified oligodeoxynucleotides
  originally synthesized on a microarray, generating sufficient bait for
  multiple captures at concentrations high enough to drive the hybridization.
  We tested this method with 170-mer baits that target >15,000 coding exons
  (2.5 Mb) and four regions (1.7 Mb total) using Illumina sequencing as
  read-out. About 90% of uniquely aligning bases fell on or near bait sequence;
  up to 50% lay on exons proper. The uniformity was such that approximately 60%
  of target bases in the exonic 'catch', and approximately 80% in the regional
  catch, had at least half the mean coverage. One lane of Illumina sequence was
  sufficient to call high-confidence genotypes for 89% of the targeted exon
  space.%

    Blood is considered to be a sterile microenvironment, in which bacteria
  appear only periodically. Previously used methods allowed only for the
  detection of either viable bacteria with low sensitivity or selected species
  of bacteria. The Next-Generation Sequencing method (NGS) enables the
  identification of all bacteria in the sample with their taxonomic
  classification. We used NGS for the analysis of blood samples from healthy
  volunteers (n = 23) and patients with sepsis (n = 62) to check whether any
  bacterial DNA exists in the blood of healthy people and to identify bacterial
  taxonomic profile in the blood of septic patients. The presence of bacterial
  DNA was found both in septic and healthy subjects; however, bacterial
  diversity was significantly different (P = 0.002) between the studied groups.
  Among healthy volunteers, a significant predominance of anaerobic bacteria
  (76.2 %), of which most were bacteria of the order Bifidobacteriales (73.0
  %), was observed. In sepsis, the majority of detected taxa belonged to
  aerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms (75.1 %). The most striking
  difference was seen in the case of Actinobacteria phyla, the abundance of
  which was decreased in sepsis (P < 0.001) and Proteobacteria phyla which was
  decreased in the healthy volunteers (P < 0.001). Our research shows that
  bacterial DNA can be detected in the blood of healthy people and that its
  taxonomic composition is different from the one seen in septic patients.
  Detection of bacterial DNA in the blood of healthy people may suggest that
  bacteria continuously translocate into the blood, but not always cause
  sepsis; this observation can be called DNAemia.%

    The human genome has been referred to as the blueprint of human biology. In
  this review we consider an essential but largely ignored overlay to that
  blueprint, the human microbiome, which is composed of those microbes that
  live in and on our bodies. The human microbiome is a source of genetic
  diversity, a modifier of disease, an essential component of immunity, and a
  functional entity that influences metabolism and modulates drug interactions.
  Characterization and analysis of the human microbiome have been greatly
  catalyzed by advances in genomic technologies. We discuss how these
  technologies have shaped this emerging field of study and advanced our
  understanding of the human microbiome. We also identify future challenges,
  many of which are common to human genetic studies, and predict that in the
  future, analyzing genetic variation and risk of human disease will sometimes
  necessitate the integration of human and microbial genomic data sets.%

    OBJECTIVES: Culture-based diagnostics represent the standard of care in
  septic patients, but are highly insensitive and in many cases unspecific. We
  recently demonstrated the general feasibility of next-generation
  sequencing-based diagnostics using free circulating nucleic acids (cell-free
  DNA) in plasma samples of septic patients. Within the presented
  investigation, higher performance of next-generation sequencing-based
  diagnostics was validated by comparison to matched blood cultures. DESIGN: A
  secondary analysis of a prospective, observational, single-center study.
  SETTING: Surgical ICU of a university hospital and research laboratory.
  PATIENTS: Fifty patients with septic shock, 20 uninfected patients with
  elective surgery as control cohort. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND
  MAIN RESULTS: From 256 plasma samples of 48 septic patients at up to seven
  consecutive time points within the 28-day observation period, cell-free DNA
  was isolated and analyzed by next-generation sequencing and relevance
  scoring. In parallel, results from culture-based diagnostics (e.g., blood
  culture) were obtained. Plausibility of blood culture and next-generation
  sequencing results as well as adequacy of antibiotic therapy was evaluated by
  an independent expert panel. In contrast to blood culture with a positivity
  rate of 33% at sepsis onset, the positivity rate for next-generation
  sequencing-based pathogen identification was 72%. Over the whole study
  period, blood culture positivity was 11%, and next-generation sequencing
  positivity was 71%. Ninety-six percent of positive next-generation sequencing
  results for acute sepsis time points were plausible and would have led to a
  change to a more adequate therapy in 53% of cases as assessed by the expert
  evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that next-generation
  sequencing-based analyses of bloodstream infections provide a valuable
  diagnostic platform for the identification of clinically relevant pathogens
  with higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture, indicating that
  patients might benefit from a more appropriate therapy based on
  next-generation sequencing-based diagnosis.%

    INTRODUCTION: Sepsis has been identified as a risk factor for human
  cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in critically ill patients. However, the
  contribution of CMV reactivation on morbidity and mortality is still
  controversial. Therefore, we analyzed the incidence and impact of CMV
  reactivation on outcome in patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: In a
  prospective longitudinal double-blinded observational study, 97 adult
  nonimmunosuppressed CMV-seropositive patients with new onset of severe sepsis
  were included. Leukocytes, plasma and tracheal secretions were examined
  weekly for CMV-DNA by PCR. Tracheal secretions were additionally tested for
  HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus)-DNA. The influence of CMV-reactivation on the
  endpoints was analysed by Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis.
  Time-dependency was evaluated by landmark analysis. RESULTS: Six out 97 died
  and five were discharged from the hospital within 72 hours and were excluded
  of the analysis. CMV reactivation occurred in 35 of the 86 (40.69%) analysed
  patients. HSV infection occurred in 23 of the 35 (65.7%) CMV reactivators. In
  10 patients CMV-plasma-DNAemia appeared with a DNA-content below 600
  copies/ml in four cases and a peak amount of 2,830 copies/ml on average. In
  patients with and without CMV reactivation mortality rates were similar
  (37.1% vs. 35.3%, P = 0.861), respectively. However, in the multivariate COX
  regression analyses CMV reactivation was independently associated with
  increased length of stay in the ICU (30.0, interquartile range 14 to 48 vs.
  12.0, interquartile range 7 to 19 days; HR (hazard ratio) 3.365; 95% CI
  (confidence interval) 1.233 to 9.183, P = 0.018) and in the hospital (33.0,
  interquartile range 24 to 62 vs. 16.0, interquartile range 10 to 24 days, HR
  3.3, 95% CI 1.78 to 6.25, P < 0.001) as well as prolonged mechanical
  ventilation (22.0, interquartile range 6 to 36 vs. 7.5, interquartile range 5
  to 15.5 days; HR 2.6,CI 95% 1.39 to 4.94; P < 0.001) and impaired pulmonary
  gas exchange (six days, interquartile range 1 to 17, vs. three, interquartile
  range 1 to 7, days in reactivators vs. non-reactivators, P = 0.038). HSV
  reactivation proved not to be a risk factor for these adverse effects.
  CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate an independent correlation between CMV
  reactivation and increased morbidity in the well-defined group of
  nonimmunosuppressed patients with severe sepsis, but CMV reactivation had no
  impact on mortality in this group with low CMV-DNA plasma levels. Thus, the
  potential harms and benefits of antiviral treatment have to be weighed
  cautiously in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.%

    IMPORTANCE: Because clinical features do not reliably distinguish bacterial
  from viral infection, many children worldwide receive unnecessary antibiotic
  treatment, while bacterial infection is missed in others. OBJECTIVE: To
  identify a blood RNA expression signature that distinguishes bacterial from
  viral infection in febrile children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  Febrile children presenting to participating hospitals in the United Kingdom,
  Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States between 2009-2013 were
  prospectively recruited, comprising a discovery group and validation group.
  Each group was classified after microbiological investigation as having
  definite bacterial infection, definite viral infection, or indeterminate
  infection. RNA expression signatures distinguishing definite bacterial from
  viral infection were identified in the discovery group and diagnostic
  performance assessed in the validation group. Additional validation was
  undertaken in separate studies of children with meningococcal disease (n =
  24) and inflammatory diseases (n = 48) and on published gene expression
  datasets. EXPOSURES: A 2-transcript RNA expression signature distinguishing
  bacterial infection from viral infection was evaluated against clinical and
  microbiological diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Definite bacterial and
  viral infection was confirmed by culture or molecular detection of the
  pathogens. Performance of the RNA signature was evaluated in the definite
  bacterial and viral group and in the indeterminate infection group. RESULTS:
  The discovery group of 240 children (median age, 19 months; 62% male)
  included 52 with definite bacterial infection, of whom 36 (69%) required
  intensive care, and 92 with definite viral infection, of whom 32 (35%)
  required intensive care. Ninety-six children had indeterminate infection.
  Analysis of RNA expression data identified a 38-transcript signature
  distinguishing bacterial from viral infection. A smaller (2-transcript)
  signature (FAM89A and IFI44L) was identified by removing highly correlated
  transcripts. When this 2-transcript signature was implemented as a disease
  risk score in the validation group (130 children, with 23 definite bacterial,
  28 definite viral, and 79 indeterminate infections; median age, 17 months;
  57% male), all 23 patients with microbiologically confirmed definite
  bacterial infection were classified as bacterial (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI,
  100%-100%]) and 27 of 28 patients with definite viral infection were
  classified as viral (specificity, 96.4% [95% CI, 89.3%-100%]). When applied
  to additional validation datasets from patients with meningococcal and
  inflammatory diseases, bacterial infection was identified with a sensitivity
  of 91.7% (95% CI, 79.2%-100%) and 90.0% (95% CI, 70.0%-100%), respectively,
  and with specificity of 96.0% (95% CI, 88.0%-100%) and 95.8% (95% CI,
  89.6%-100%). Of the children in the indeterminate groups, 46.3% (63/136) were
  classified as having bacterial infection, although 94.9% (129/136) received
  antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides
  preliminary data regarding test accuracy of a 2-transcript host RNA signature
  discriminating bacterial from viral infection in febrile children. Further
  studies are needed in diverse groups of patients to assess accuracy and
  clinical utility of this test in different clinical settings.%

    We have developed an online catalog of SNP-trait associations from
  published genome-wide association studies for use in investigating genomic
  characteristics of trait/disease-associated SNPs (TASs). Reported TASs were
  common [median risk allele frequency 36%, interquartile range (IQR) 21%-53%]
  and were associated with modest effect sizes [median odds ratio (OR) 1.33,
  IQR 1.20-1.61]. Among 20 genomic annotation sets, reported TASs were
  significantly overrepresented only in nonsynonymous sites [OR = 3.9
  (2.2-7.0), p = 3.5 x 10(-7)] and 5kb-promoter regions [OR = 2.3 (1.5-3.6), p
  = 3 x 10(-4)] compared to SNPs randomly selected from genotyping arrays.
  Although 88% of TASs were intronic (45%) or intergenic (43%), TASs were not
  overrepresented in introns and were significantly depleted in intergenic
  regions [OR = 0.44 (0.34-0.58), p = 2.0 x 10(-9)]. Only slightly more TASs
  than expected by chance were predicted to be in regions under positive
  selection [OR = 1.3 (0.8-2.1), p = 0.2]. This new online resource, together
  with bioinformatic predictions of the underlying functionality at
  trait/disease-associated loci, is well-suited to guide future investigations
  of the role of common variants in complex disease etiology.%

    BACKGROUND: Integration of rapid diagnostic testing via matrix-assisted
  laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) with antimicrobial
  stewardship team (AST) intervention has the potential for early organism
  identification, customization of antibiotic therapy, and improvement in
  patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of
  this combined approach on clinical and antimicrobial therapy-related outcomes
  in patients with bloodstream infections. METHODS: A pre-post
  quasi-experimental study was conducted to analyze the impact of MALDI-TOF
  with AST intervention in patients with bloodstream infections. The AST
  provided evidence-based antibiotic recommendations after receiving real-time
  notification following blood culture Gram stain, organism identification, and
  antimicrobial susceptibilities. Outcomes were compared to a historic control
  group. RESULTS: A total of 501 patients with bacteremia or candidemia were
  included in the final analysis: 245 patients in the intervention group and
  256 patients in the preintervention group. MALDI-TOF with AST intervention
  decreased time to organism identification (84.0 vs 55.9 hours, P < .001), and
  improved time to effective antibiotic therapy (30.1 vs 20.4 hours, P = .021)
  and optimal antibiotic therapy (90.3 vs 47.3 hours, P < .001). Mortality
  (20.3% vs 14.5%), length of intensive care unit stay (14.9 vs 8.3 days) and
  recurrent bacteremia (5.9% vs 2.0%) were lower in the intervention group on
  univariate analysis, and acceptance of an AST intervention was associated
  with a trend toward reduced mortality on multivariable analysis (odds ratio,
  0.55, P = .075). CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF with AST intervention decreased time
  to organism identification and time to effective and optimal antibiotic
  therapy.%

    BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children globally.
  Clinical algorithms remain suboptimal for distinguishing severe pneumonia
  from other causes of respiratory distress such as malaria or distinguishing
  bacterial pneumonia and pneumonia from others causes, such as viruses.
  Molecular tools could improve diagnosis and management. METHODS: We conducted
  a mass spectrometry-based proteomic study to identify and validate markers of
  severity in 390 Gambian children with pneumonia (n = 204) and age-, sex-, and
  neighborhood-matched controls (n = 186). Independent validation was conducted
  in 293 Kenyan children with respiratory distress (238 with pneumonia, 41 with
  Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and 14 with both). Predictive value was
  estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
  (AUC). RESULTS: Lipocalin 2 (Lpc-2) was the best protein biomarker of severe
  pneumonia (AUC, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, .64-.79]) and highly
  predictive of bacteremia (78% [64%-92%]), pneumococcal bacteremia (84%
  [71%-98%]), and "probable bacterial etiology" (91% [84%-98%]). These results
  were validated in Kenyan children with severe malaria and respiratory
  distress who also met the World Health Organization definition of pneumonia.
  The combination of Lpc-2 and haptoglobin distinguished bacterial versus
  malaria origin of respiratory distress with high sensitivity and specificity
  in Gambian children (AUC, 99% [95% confidence interval, 99%-100%]) and Kenyan
  children (82% [74%-91%]). CONCLUSIONS: Lpc-2 and haptoglobin can help
  discriminate the etiology of clinically defined pneumonia and could be used
  to improve clinical management. These biomarkers should be further evaluated
  in prospective clinical studies.%

    Although commensal bacteria are crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis
  of the intestine, the role of commensal bacteria in immune responses at other
  mucosal surfaces remains less clear. Here, we show that commensal microbiota
  composition critically regulates the generation of virus-specific CD4 and CD8
  T cells and antibody responses following respiratory influenza virus
  infection. By using various antibiotic treatments, we found that
  neomycin-sensitive bacteria are associated with the induction of productive
  immune responses in the lung. Local or distal injection of Toll-like receptor
  (TLR) ligands could rescue the immune impairment in the antibiotic-treated
  mice. Intact microbiota provided signals leading to the expression of mRNA
  for pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 at steady state. Following influenza virus
  infection, inflammasome activation led to migration of dendritic cells (DCs)
  from the lung to the draining lymph node and T-cell priming. Our results
  reveal the importance of commensal microbiota in regulating immunity in the
  respiratory mucosa through the proper activation of inflammasomes.%

    BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of
  hospitalization and death among U.S. adults. Incidence estimates of pneumonia
  confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic
  tests are needed. METHODS: We conducted active population-based surveillance
  for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults 18
  years of age or older in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville. Patients
  with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression were excluded. Blood,
  urine, and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for culture,
  serologic testing, antigen detection, and molecular diagnostic testing. Study
  radiologists independently reviewed chest radiographs. We calculated
  population-based incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia requiring
  hospitalization according to age and pathogen. RESULTS: From January 2010
  through June 2012, we enrolled 2488 of 3634 eligible adults (68%). Among 2320
  adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia (93%), the median age of the
  patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 46 to 71); 498 patients (21%)
  required intensive care, and 52 (2%) died. Among 2259 patients who had
  radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens available for both bacterial
  and viral testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%): one or more viruses
  in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacterial and viral pathogens in 59
  (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). The most common
  pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%),
  and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%). The annual incidence of pneumonia was
  24.8 cases (95% confidence interval, 23.5 to 26.1) per 10,000 adults, with
  the highest rates among adults 65 to 79 years of age (63.0 cases per 10,000
  adults) and those 80 years of age or older (164.3 cases per 10,000 adults).
  For each pathogen, the incidence increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The
  incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was
  highest among the oldest adults. Despite current diagnostic tests, no
  pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. Respiratory viruses were
  detected more frequently than bacteria. (Funded by the Influenza Division of
  the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases.).%

    DNA sequence variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes mediate
  susceptibility to a wide range of human diseases. The complex genetic
  structure of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) makes it difficult,
  however, to collect genotyping data in large cohorts. Long-range linkage
  disequilibrium between HLA loci and SNP markers across the major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) region offers an alternative approach
  through imputation to interrogate HLA variation in existing GWAS data sets.
  Here we describe a computational strategy, SNP2HLA, to impute classical
  alleles and amino acid polymorphisms at class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II
  (-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1) loci. To characterize performance of
  SNP2HLA, we constructed two European ancestry reference panels, one based on
  data collected in HapMap-CEPH pedigrees (90 individuals) and another based on
  data collected by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC, 5,225
  individuals). We imputed HLA alleles in an independent data set from the
  British 1958 Birth Cohort (N = 918) with gold standard four-digit HLA types
  and SNPs genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K and Illumina
  Immunochip microarrays. We demonstrate that the sample size of the reference
  panel, rather than SNP density of the genotyping platform, is critical to
  achieve high imputation accuracy. Using the larger T1DGC reference panel, the
  average accuracy at four-digit resolution is 94.7% using the low-density
  Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K, and 96.7% using the high-density Illumina
  Immunochip. For amino acid polymorphisms within HLA genes, we achieve 98.6%
  and 99.3% accuracy using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K and Illumina
  Immunochip, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate how imputation and
  association testing at amino acid resolution can facilitate fine-mapping of
  primary MHC association signals, giving a specific example from type 1
  diabetes.%

    It was hypothesized that the EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell response may be
  dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, possibly leading to a
  suboptimal control of this virus. To examine the CD8(+) T cell response in
  greater detail, we analyzed the HLA-A2-, HLA-B7-, and HLA-B8-restricted EBV-
  and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in a high number of MS patients and
  control subjects using tetramers. Content in cytolytic granules, as well as
  cytotoxic activity, of EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells was assessed. We
  found that MS patients had a lower or a higher prevalence of HLA-A2 and
  HLA-B7, respectively. Using HLA class I tetramers in HLA-B7(+) MS patients,
  there was a higher prevalence of MS patients with
  HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific CD8(+) T cells ex vivo. However, the magnitude
  of the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific and HLA-B*0702/CMV(TPR)-specific CD8(+) T
  cell response (i.e., the percentage of tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in a study
  subject harboring CD8(+) T cells specific for the given epitope) was lower in
  MS patients. No differences were found using other tetramers. After
  stimulation with the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP) peptide, the production of IL-2,
  perforin, and granzyme B and the cytotoxicity of HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific
  CD8(+) T cells were decreased. Altogether, our findings suggest that the
  HLA-B*0702-restricted viral (in particular the EBV one)-specific CD8(+) T
  cell response is dysregulated in MS patients. This observation is
  particularly interesting knowing that the HLA-B7 allele is more frequently
  expressed in MS patients and considering that EBV is associated with MS.%

    BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) after
  sustained virological response (SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) is
  unclear. Our aim was to examine the risk and determinants of HCC in patients
  cured with DAA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of
  hepatitis C virus patients who were treated with DAA in any of the 129
  Veterans Health Administration hospitals between January 1, 2015 and December
  31, 2015. We calculated the annual incidence rates of HCC by SVR. We used Cox
  regression models to compare the risk of HCC in patients with vs those
  without SVR and to identify factors associated with incident HCC among
  patients with SVR. We reviewed a sample of HCC patients for tumor size and
  stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 22,500 patients treated with DAA (19,518
  with SVR; 2982 without SVR), the mean (standard deviation) age was 61.6 (6.1)
  years, and 39.0% had cirrhosis. There were 271 new cases of HCC, including
  183 in patients with SVR. Compared with patients without SVR, those with SVR
  had a significantly reduced risk of HCC (0.90 vs 3.45 HCC/100 person-years;
  adjusted hazard ratio, 0.28, 95% CI=0.22-0.36). Patients with cirrhosis had
  the highest annual incidence of HCC after SVR (1.82 vs 0.34/100 person-years
  in patients without cirrhosis; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.73. 95% CI,
  3.34-6.68). Most (>44.8%) HCC were classified as stage I. Maximum size of the
  largest lesion was </=5 cm in over 75% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
  treated with DAA, SVR was associated with a considerable reduction in the
  risk of HCC. We did not find any evidence to suggest that DAAs promote HCC.
  However, in patients with SVR, the absolute risk of HCC remained high in
  patients with established cirrhosis. These patients should be considered for
  ongoing HCC surveillance.%

    BACKGROUND: With the advent of high throughput biotechnology data
  acquisition platforms such as micro arrays, SNP chips and mass spectrometers,
  data sets with many more variables than observations are now routinely being
  collected. Finding relationships between response variables of interest and
  variables in such data sets is an important problem akin to finding needles
  in a haystack. Whilst methods for a number of response types have been
  developed a general approach has been lacking. RESULTS: The major
  contribution of this paper is to present a unified methodology which allows
  many common (statistical) response models to be fitted to such data sets. The
  class of models includes virtually any model with a linear predictor in it,
  for example (but not limited to), multiclass logistic regression
  (classification), generalised linear models (regression) and survival models.
  A fast algorithm for finding sparse well fitting models is presented. The
  ideas are illustrated on real data sets with numbers of variables ranging
  from thousands to millions. R code implementing the ideas is available for
  download. CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper enables existing
  work on response models when there are less variables than observations to be
  leveraged to the situation when there are many more variables than
  observations. It is a powerful approach to finding parsimonious models for
  such datasets. The method is capable of handling problems with millions of
  variables and a large variety of response types within the one framework. The
  method compares favourably to existing methods such as support vector
  machines and random forests, but has the advantage of not requiring separate
  variable selection steps. It is also works for data types which these methods
  were not designed to handle. The method usually produces very sparse models
  which make biological interpretation simpler and more focused.%

    BACKGROUND & AIMS: HLA class I alleles are linked to spontaneous control of
  hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1, but for HCV the
  roles of particular alleles and corresponding CD8(+) T-cell responses remain
  incompletely defined. We aimed to determine the correlations between these
  alleles and natural outcomes of HCV and determine associated key T-cell
  responses. METHODS: In a cohort of HCV individuals, we determined HLA class I
  alleles, HCV outcomes, T-cell responses, and examined sequence data for
  mutational changes within key epitopes. RESULTS: Carriage of HLA-B 57 was
  associated with a higher rate of viral clearance (risk ratio = 2.0; 95%
  confidence interval: 1.2-3.4), while HLA-B 08 was associated with a lower
  rate (risk ratio = 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9]. Two HLA-B
  57-restricted T-cell epitopes were targeted in spontaneous clearance;
  subjects with chronic viremia expressing HLA-B 57 harbored HCV strains with a
  high frequency of mutations in key residues. HLA-B 57-mediated escape was
  supported by diminished immune recognition of these variants and acute HCV
  infection revealing viral evolution toward less recognized variants. Analysis
  of a genotype 1b strain from a single-source HCV outbreak in which HLA-B 57
  was not protective revealed sequence variations that interfere with
  immunogenicity, thereby preventing HLA-B 57-mediated immune pressure.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a role of HLA-B 57-restricted CD8(+) T-cell
  responses in mediating spontaneous clearance and evolution in HCV infection,
  and viral strains containing epitope variants that are less recognized
  abrogate the protective effects of HLA-B 57. The finding that HLA-B
  57-mediated antiviral immunity is associated with control of both human
  immunodeficiency virus-1 and HCV suggests a common shared mechanism of a
  successful immune response against persistent viruses.%

    UNLABELLED: Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a 100%
  association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, only three EBV genomes
  isolated from NPC patients have been sequenced to date, and the role of EBV
  genomic variations in the pathogenesis of NPC is unclear. We sought to obtain
  the sequences of EBV genomes in multiple NPC biopsy specimens in the same
  geographic location in order to reveal their sequence diversity. Three
  published EBV (B95-8, C666-1, and HKNPC1) genomes were first resequenced
  using the sequencing workflow of target enrichment of EBV DNA by
  hybridization, followed by next-generation sequencing, de novo assembly, and
  joining of contigs by Sanger sequencing. The sequences of eight NPC biopsy
  specimen-derived EBV (NPC-EBV) genomes, designated HKNPC2 to HKNPC9, were
  then determined. They harbored 1,736 variations in total, including 1,601
  substitutions, 64 insertions, and 71 deletions, compared to the reference
  EBV. Furthermore, genes encoding latent, early lytic, and tegument proteins
  and glycoproteins were found to contain nonsynonymous mutations of potential
  biological significance. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HKNPC6 and -7
  genomes, which were isolated from tumor biopsy specimens of advanced
  metastatic NPC cases, were distinct from the other six NPC-EBV genomes,
  suggesting the presence of at least two parental lineages of EBV among the
  NPC-EBV genomes. In conclusion, much greater sequence diversity among EBV
  isolates derived from NPC biopsy specimens is demonstrated on a whole-genome
  level through a complete sequencing workflow. Large-scale sequencing and
  comparison of EBV genomes isolated from NPC and normal subjects should be
  performed to assess whether EBV genomic variations contribute to NPC
  pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: This study established a sequencing workflow from
  EBV DNA capture and sequencing to de novo assembly and contig joining. We
  reported eight newly sequenced EBV genomes isolated from primary NPC biopsy
  specimens and revealed the sequence diversity on a whole-genome level among
  these EBV isolates. At least two lineages of EBV strains are observed, and
  recombination among these lineages is inferred. Our study has demonstrated
  the value of, and provided a platform for, genome sequencing of EBV.%

    CONTEXT: -The rapid and accurate diagnosis of Zika virus infection is an
  international priority. OBJECTIVE: -To review current recommendations,
  methods, limitations, and priorities for Zika virus testing. DATA SOURCES:
  -Sources include published literature, public health recommendations,
  laboratory procedures, and testing experience. CONCLUSIONS: -Until recently,
  the laboratory diagnosis of Zika infection was confined to public health or
  research laboratories that prepared their own reagents, and test capacity has
  been limited. Furthermore, Zika cross-reacts serologically with other
  flaviviruses, such as dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. Current or past
  infection, or even vaccination with another flavivirus, will often cause
  false-positive or uninterpretable Zika serology results. Detection of viral
  RNA during acute infection using nucleic acid amplification tests provides
  more specific results, and a number of commercial nucleic acid amplification
  tests have received emergency use authorization. In addition to serum,
  testing of whole blood and urine is recommended because of the higher vial
  loads and longer duration of shedding. However, nucleic acid amplification
  testing has limited utility because many patients are asymptomatic or present
  for testing after the brief period of Zika shedding has passed. Thus, the
  greatest need and most difficult challenge is development of accurate
  antibody tests for the diagnosis of recent Zika infection. Research is
  urgently needed to identify Zika virus epitopes that do not cross-react with
  other flavivirus antigens. New information is emerging at a rapid pace and,
  with ongoing public-private and international collaborations and government
  support, it is hoped that rapid progress will be made in developing robust
  and widely applicable diagnostic tools.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) lead to more deaths each year
  than any other infectious disease category. Despite this, etiologic LRTI
  pathogens are infrequently identified due to limitations of existing
  microbiologic tests. In critically ill patients, noninfectious inflammatory
  syndromes resembling LRTIs further complicate diagnosis. To address the need
  for improved LRTI diagnostics, we performed metagenomic next-generation
  sequencing (mNGS) on tracheal aspirates from 92 adults with acute respiratory
  failure and simultaneously assessed pathogens, the airway microbiome, and the
  host transcriptome. To differentiate pathogens from respiratory commensals,
  we developed a rules-based model (RBM) and logistic regression model (LRM) in
  a derivation cohort of 20 patients with LRTIs or noninfectious acute
  respiratory illnesses. When tested in an independent validation cohort of 24
  patients, both models achieved accuracies of 95.5%. We next developed
  pathogen, microbiome diversity, and host gene expression metrics to identify
  LRTI-positive patients and differentiate them from critically ill controls
  with noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in the validation
  cohort, the pathogen metric performed with an area under the
  receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-1.00), the diversity
  metric with an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63-0.98), and the host transcriptional
  classifier with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00). Combining these achieved
  a negative predictive value of 100%. This study suggests that a single
  streamlined protocol offering an integrated genomic portrait of pathogen,
  microbiome, and host transcriptome may hold promise as a tool for LRTI
  diagnosis.%

    Sepsis is a common cause of death, but outcomes in individual patients are
  difficult to predict. Elucidating the molecular processes that differ between
  sepsis patients who survive and those who die may permit more appropriate
  treatments to be deployed. We examined the clinical features and the plasma
  metabolome and proteome of patients with and without community-acquired
  sepsis, upon their arrival at hospital emergency departments and 24 hours
  later. The metabolomes and proteomes of patients at hospital admittance who
  would ultimately die differed markedly from those of patients who would
  survive. The different profiles of proteins and metabolites clustered into
  the following groups: fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation,
  gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. They differed consistently among
  several sets of patients, and diverged more as death approached. In contrast,
  the metabolomes and proteomes of surviving patients with mild sepsis did not
  differ from survivors with severe sepsis or septic shock. An algorithm
  derived from clinical features together with measurements of five metabolites
  predicted patient survival. This algorithm may help to guide the treatment of
  individual patients with sepsis.%

    We are facing a global metabolic health crisis provoked by an obesity
  epidemic. Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population
  sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups
  of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut
  bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial
  species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness
  (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity,
  insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory
  phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese
  individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight
  over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between
  individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and
  obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut
  microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult
  population who may be at increased risk of progressing to
  adiposity-associated co-morbidities.%

    The pathogenesis of infectious diseases depends on the interaction of host
  and pathogen. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, host and parasite processes
  can be assessed by dual RNA sequencing of blood from infected patients. We
  performed dual transcriptome analyses on samples from 46 malaria-infected
  Gambian children to reveal mechanisms driving the systemic pathophysiology of
  severe malaria. Integrating these transcriptomic data with estimates of
  parasite load and detailed clinical information allowed consideration of
  potentially confounding effects due to differing leukocyte proportions in
  blood, parasite developmental stage, and whole-body pathogen load. We report
  hundreds of human and parasite genes differentially expressed between severe
  and uncomplicated malaria, with distinct profiles associated with coma,
  hyperlactatemia, and thrombocytopenia. High expression of neutrophil
  granule-related genes was consistently associated with all severe malaria
  phenotypes. We observed severity-associated variation in the expression of
  parasite genes, which determine cytoadhesion to vascular endothelium,
  rigidity of infected erythrocytes, and parasite growth rate. Up to 99% of
  human differential gene expression in severe malaria was driven by
  differences in parasite load, whereas parasite gene expression showed little
  association with parasite load. Coexpression analyses revealed interactions
  between human and P. falciparum, with prominent co-regulation of translation
  genes in severe malaria between host and parasite. Multivariate analyses
  suggested that increased expression of granulopoiesis and
  interferon-gamma-related genes, together with inadequate suppression of type
  1 interferon signaling, best explained severity of infection. These findings
  provide a framework for understanding the contributions of host and parasite
  to the pathogenesis of severe malaria and identifying new treatments.%

    BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Early recognition of causative pathogens is critical
  for the appropriate management of central nervous system infection and
  improved outcomes. The BioFire((R)) FilmArray((R)) Meningitis/Encephalitis
  Panel (BioFire((R)) ME Panel, BioFire Diagnostics) is the first U.S. Food and
  Drug Administration (FDA)-approved multiplex PCR assay that allows the rapid
  detection of 14 pathogens, including bacteria (n = 6), viruses (n = 7), and
  fungi (n = 1), from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The performance of the panel
  is expected to be dependent on the epidemiology of M/E in different
  geographical regions. METHODS: In this preliminary study, we used the
  BioFire((R)) ME Panel in 42 subjects who presented to the emergency
  department with symptoms of M/E in our hospital. The results were compared to
  conventional culture, antigen detection, PCR, and various laboratory
  findings. RESULTS: The panel detected six positive samples, of which five
  were viral and one bacterial. We observed an overall agreement rate of 88%
  between the BioFire((R)) ME Panel results and the conventional methods. There
  were no false-positive findings, but five discordant results were observed
  for enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, Escherichia coli, and
  Cryptococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: The BioFire((R)) ME Panel performed
  equivalently to the traditional PCR methods for virus detection, and better
  than bacterial cultures. This revolutionary system represents a paradigm
  shift in the diagnosis of M/E and may aid in the rapid identification of
  community-acquired M/E. However, the usefulness of this tool is limited in
  regions with a high prevalence of infectious M/E caused by microorganisms not
  included in the panel.%

    Heterogeneity and latent variables are now widely recognized as major
  sources of bias and variability in high-throughput experiments. The most
  well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch
  effects-when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or
  by different people. However, there are also a large number of other
  variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here
  we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted
  sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports
  surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for
  known batch effects with the ComBat function and adjustment for batch and
  latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function.%

    Fourteen oligonucleotides 8-21 nucleotides in length and their complements
  were synthesized as DNA and RNA. For each sequence, four kinds of duplexes,
  DNA:DNA, RNA:RNA, DNA:RNA, and RNA:DNA, were prepared. Twelve sequences had
  A.T/U content varying from 25 to 80% and dPy content in the DNA strands
  varying from 0 to 100%. Thermodynamic stabilities of four duplexes for each
  sequence were determined in solution containing 100 mM Na+, 10 mM phosphate,
  and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1. CD spectra and electrophoretic mobility on native
  polyacrylamide gel were measured for most duplexes. Quantitative correlations
  of hybrid stability both with deoxypyrimidine content and, at fixed dPy
  content, with the fraction of A.T/U in duplexes were found. We also
  demonstrated that hybrids with 70-80% deoxypyrimidine DNA strand and a high
  or moderate A.T/U fraction displayed the highest relative stability compared
  to their RNA counterparts. Relationships of relative intensities of CD bands
  at 210 nm and relative electrophoretic mobilities of hybrids with relative
  hybrid stability suggested that hybrid conformation varies continuously
  between A- and B-form and is the decisive factor in relative hybrid
  stability.%

    OBJECTIVE: In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the
  Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a "Consensus Conference,"
  the goals of which were "to provide a conceptual and a practical framework to
  define the systemic inflammatory response to infection, which is a
  progressive injurious process that falls under the generalized term 'sepsis'
  and includes sepsis-associated organ dysfunction as well." The general
  definitions introduced as a result of that conference have been widely used
  in practice and have served as the foundation for inclusion criteria for
  numerous clinical trials of therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there
  has been an impetus from experts in the field to modify these definitions to
  reflect our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these syndromes.
  DESIGN: Several North American and European intensive care societies agreed
  to revisit the definitions for sepsis and related conditions. This conference
  was sponsored by the SCCM, The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine
  (ESICM), The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American
  Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS). METHODS:
  The conference was attended by 29 participants from Europe and North America.
  In advance of the conference, five subgroups were formed to evaluate the
  following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines,
  microbiologic data, and coagulation parameters. The subgroups corresponded
  electronically before the conference and met in person during the conference.
  A spokesperson for each group presented the deliberation of each group to all
  conference participants during a plenary session. A writing committee was
  formed at the conference and developed the current article based on executive
  summary documents generated by each group and the plenary group
  presentations. The present article serves as the final report of the 2001
  International Sepsis Definitions Conference. CONCLUSION: This document
  reflects a process whereby a group of experts and opinion leaders revisited
  the 1992 sepsis guidelines and found that apart from expanding the list of
  signs and symptoms of sepsis to reflect clinical bedside experience, no
  evidence exists to support a change to the definitions. This lack of evidence
  serves to underscore the challenge still present in diagnosing sepsis in 2003
  for clinicians and researchers and also provides the basis for introducing
  PIRO as a hypothesis-generating model for future research.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The worst known H1N1 influenza pandemic in history resulted in more than 20
  million deaths in 1918 and 1919. Although the underlying mechanism causing
  the extreme virulence of the 1918 influenza virus is still obscure, our
  previous functional genomics analyses revealed a correlation between the
  lethality of the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus (r1918) in mice and a
  unique gene expression pattern associated with severe immune responses in the
  lungs. Lately, microRNAs have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for
  gene expression. To determine whether differential expression of cellular
  microRNAs plays a role in the host response to r1918 infection, we compared
  the lung cellular "microRNAome" of mice infected by r1918 virus with that of
  mice infected by a nonlethal seasonal influenza virus, A/Texas/36/91. We
  found that a group of microRNAs, including miR-200a and miR-223, were
  differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection and that
  r1918 and A/Texas/36/91 infection induced distinct microRNA expression
  profiles. Moreover, we observed significant enrichment in the number of
  predicted cellular target mRNAs whose expression was inversely correlated
  with the expression of these microRNAs. Intriguingly, gene ontology analysis
  revealed that many of these mRNAs play roles in immune response and cell
  death pathways, which are known to be associated with the extreme virulence
  of r1918. This is the first demonstration that cellular gene expression
  patterns in influenza virus-infected mice may be attributed in part to
  microRNA regulation and that such regulation may be a contributing factor to
  the extreme virulence of the r1918.%

    BACKGROUND: Herpes viruses can be reactivated among immunocompetent
  patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes
  simplex virus (HSV) have been the most studied. We hypothesized that
  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could also be reactivated in immunocompetent
  patients during their stay in ICU and that this would be associated with
  morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This prospective observational study
  included 90 patients with an ICU stay of >/= 5 days. CMV and HSV were
  considered when clinically suspected and DNA was researched in blood or
  bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). EBV DNA viral quantification was performed in
  the blood samples. RESULTS: EBV DNA was detected in blood of 61 patients
  (median length for positivity of 7.5 days). CMV DNA was detected in blood of
  16 patients (median length for positivity of 13.5 days) and BAL of 6
  patients. HSV1 DNA was detected in the BAL of 28 patients (median length for
  positivity of 7.5 days). Nineteen patients had no viral reactivation, 1
  experienced only CMV, 32 had only EBV, 5 had only HSV, 6 had EBV and CMV, 14
  had EBV and HSV, and 9 patients reactivated three viruses. Mortality was
  higher among patients with EBV reactivation (33/61 vs. 7/25, p = 0.02).
  Length of stay (21 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001) and length of mechanical
  ventilation (15 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001) were higher among patients with EBV
  reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that EBV DNA is detected in blood
  of diverse ICU patients with >/= 5 days of stay and that it is associated
  with morbidity and mortality. Larger dynamic prospective studies are needed
  to correlate viral reactivation with immune system evolution during ICU stay
  and to determine the role of polyviral reactivations.%

    Haplotype phasing is a fundamental problem in medical and population
  genetics. Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a
  genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large
  cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead
  explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing
  algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort
  sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference
  panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data
  structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate
  that Eagle2 attains a approximately 20x speedup and approximately 10%
  increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On
  European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves >2x the
  accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing. Eagle2 is open source and freely
  available for HRC-based phasing via the Sanger Imputation Service and the
  Michigan Imputation Server.%

    Management of severe sepsis, an acute illness with high morbidity and
  mortality, suffers from the lack of effective biomarkers and largely
  empirical predictions of disease progression and therapeutic responses. We
  conducted a genome-wide association study using a large randomized clinical
  trial cohort to discover genetic biomarkers of response to therapy and
  prognosis utilizing novel approaches, including combination markers, to
  overcome limitations of single-marker analyses. Sepsis prognostic models were
  dominated by clinical variables with genetic markers less informative. In
  contrast, evidence for gene-gene interactions were identified for sepsis
  treatment responses with genetic biomarkers dominating models for predicting
  therapeutic responses, yielding candidates for replication in other cohorts.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Viral infection is commonly associated with virus-driven hijacking of host
  proteins. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects
  host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1
  (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of
  influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic)
  that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation
  complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the
  NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated
  transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the
  antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza
  infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and
  renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic
  in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression
  selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response.%

    The majority of laboratory tests performed for the diagnosis of Lyme

    The systemic inflammatory response is biologically complex, redundant, and
  activated by both infectious and noninfectious triggers. Its manipulation can
  cause both benefit and harm. More than 100 randomized clinical trials have
  tested the hypothesis that modulating the septic response to infection can
  improve survival. With one short-lived exception, none of these has resulted
  in new treatments. The current challenge for sepsis research lies in a
  failure of concept and reluctance to abandon a demonstrably ineffectual
  research model. Future success will necessitate large studies of clinical and
  biochemical epidemiology to understand the course of illness, better
  integration of basic and clinical science, and the creation of stratification

    BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common and frequently fatal condition. Human
  recombinant activated protein C (APC) has been used to reduce the high rate
  of death by severe sepsis or septic shock. This is an update of a Cochrane
  review (originally published in 2007 and updated in 2008). OBJECTIVES: We
  assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of APC for the treatment of
  patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. SEARCH METHODS: For this updated
  review we searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6); MEDLINE
  (1966 to June 2010); EMBASE (1980 to July 1, 2010); BIOSIS (1965 to July 1,
  2010); CINAHL (1982 to 16 June 2010) and LILACS (1982 to 16 June 2010). There
  was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized
  controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of APC for severe sepsis in
  adults and children. We excluded studies on neonates. We considered all-cause
  mortality at day 28, at the end of study follow up, and hospital mortality as
  the primary outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently
  performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We
  estimated relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured
  statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects
  model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one new RCT in this update. We included a
  total of five RCTs involving 5101 participants. For 28-day mortality, APC did
  not reduce the risk of death in adult participants with severe sepsis (pooled
  RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.22; P = 0.82, I(2) = 68%).
  APC use was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.47, 95% CI
  1.09 to 2.00; P = 0.01, I(2) = 0%). In paediatric patients, APC did not
  reduce the risk of death (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.46; P = 0.93). Although
  the included trials had no major limitations most of them modified their
  original completion or recruitment protocols. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This
  updated review found no evidence suggesting that APC should be used for
  treating patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Additionally, APC is
  associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Unless additional RCTs provide
  evidence of a treatment effect, policy-makers, clinicians and academics
  should not promote the use of APC.Warning: On October 25th 2011, the European
  Medicines Agency issued a press release on the worldwide withdrawal of Xigris
  (activated protein C / drotrecogin alfa) from the market by Eli Lilly due to
  lack of beneficial effect on 28-day mortality in the PROWESS-SHOCK study.
  Furthermore, Eli Lily has announced the discontinuation of all other ongoing
  clinical trials. The final results of the PROWESS-SHOCK study are expected to
  be published in 2012. This systematic review will be updated when results of
  the PROWESS-SHOCK or other trials are published.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We describe a reference panel of 64,976 human haplotypes at 39,235,157 SNPs
  constructed using whole-genome sequence data from 20 studies of predominantly
  European ancestry. Using this resource leads to accurate genotype imputation
  at minor allele frequencies as low as 0.1% and a large increase in the number
  of SNPs tested in association studies, and it can help to discover and refine
  causal loci. We describe remote server resources that allow researchers to
  carry out imputation and phasing consistently and efficiently.%

    OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of 100 mg of HA-1A and placebo in
  reducing the 14-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with septic shock
  and gram-negative bacteremia in the Centocor: HA-1A Efficacy in Septic Shock
  (CHESS) trial, and to assess the safety of 100 mg of HA-1A given to patients
  with septic shock who did not have gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN: Large,
  simple, group-sequential, randomized, double-blind, multicenter,
  placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 603 investigators at 513 community and
  university-affiliated hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Within 6
  hours before enrollment, the patients had been in shock with a systolic blood
  pressure of less than 90 mm Hg after adequate fluid challenge or had received
  vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. These episodes of shock began within
  24 hours of enrollment. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of gram-negative
  infection as the cause of the shock episode and a commitment from the
  patients' physicians to provide full supportive care were required.
  MEASUREMENTS: Blood cultures were obtained within 48 hours of enrollment, and
  death at day 14 after treatment was recorded. Adverse events occurring within
  14 days after enrollment were also tabulated. RESULTS: 2199 patients were
  enrolled; 621 (28.2%) met all enrollment criteria, received HA-1A or placebo,
  and had confirmed gram-negative bacteremia. Mortality rates in this group
  were as follows: placebo, 32% (95 and HA-1A, 33% (109 of 328) (P = 0.864,
  Fisher exact test, two-tailed; 95% CI for the difference, -6.2% to 8.6%).
  Mortality rates in the patients without gram-negative bacteremia were as
  follows: placebo, 37% (292 of 793) and HA-1A, 41% (318 of 785) (P = 0.073,
  Fisher exact test, one-tailed; CI, -0.8% to 8.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In this
  trial, HA-1A was not effective in reducing the 14-day mortality rate in
  patients with gram-negative bacteremia and septic shock. These data do not
  support using septic shock as an indication for HA-1A treatment. If HA-1A is
  effective in reducing the mortality rate in patients dying from endotoxemia,
  these patients must be identified using other treatment criteria.%

    Interleukin-10 (IL-10), first recognized for its ability to inhibit
  activation and effector function of T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, is a
  multifunctional cytokine with diverse effects on most hemopoietic cell types.
  The principal routine function of IL-10 appears to be to limit and ultimately
  terminate inflammatory responses. In addition to these activities, IL-10
  regulates growth and/or differentiation of B cells, NK cells, cytotoxic and
  helper T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and
  endothelial cells. IL-10 plays a key role in differentiation and function of
  a newly appreciated type of T cell, the T regulatory cell, which may figure
  prominently in control of immune responses and tolerance in vivo. Uniquely
  among hemopoietic cytokines, IL-10 has closely related homologs in several
  virus genomes, which testify to its crucial role in regulating immune and
  inflammatory responses. This review highlights findings that have advanced
  our understanding of IL-10 and its receptor, as well as its in vivo function
  in health and disease.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to target many aspects of the
  host's immune response. The cytokine IFN-gamma plays a central role in
  resistance of the host to infection via direct antiviral effects as well as
  modulation of the immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the
  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early protein, BZLF1, inhibits the
  IFN-gamma signaling pathway. BZLF1 decreases the ability of IFN-gamma to
  activate a variety of important downstream target genes, such as IRF-1, p48,
  and CIITA, and prevents IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC surface expression.
  Additionally, BZLF1 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrate that BZLF1 decreases
  expression of the IFN-gamma receptor, suggesting a mechanism by which EBV may
  escape antiviral immune responses during primary infection.%

    Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses play an important role in the natural
  course of infection; however, the impact of certain CD8+ T cell responses in
  determining clinical outcome has not been fully defined. A well-defined
  cohort of women inoculated with HCV from a single source showed that HLA-B27
  has a strong association with spontaneous clearance. The immunological basis
  for this association is unknown. However, the finding is especially
  significant because HLA-B27 has also been shown to have a protective role in
  HIV infection. We report the identification of an HLA-B27 restricted
  hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T cell epitope that is recognized in
  the majority of recovered HLA-B27 positive women. In chronically HCV-infected
  individuals, analysis of the corresponding viral sequence showed a strong
  association between sequence variations within this epitope and expression of
  HLA-B27, indicating allele-specific selection pressure at the population
  level. Functional analysis in 3 chronically HCV-infected patients showed that
  the emerging variant viral epitopes represent escape mutations. In
  conclusion, our results suggest a dominant role of HLA-B27 in mediating
  spontaneous viral clearance as well as viral evolution in HCV infection and
  mechanistically link both associations to a dominant novel CD8+ T cell
  epitope. These results support the central role of virus-specific CD8+ T
  cells and the genetically determined restriction of the virus-specific T cell
  repertoire in HCV infection.%

    Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits have
  yielded more reproducible associations than had been discovered using any
  other approach, the loci characterized to date do not account for much of the
  heritability to such traits and, in general, have not led to improved
  understanding of the biology underlying complex phenotypes. Using a web site
  we developed to serve results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)
  studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HapMap samples
  (http://www.scandb.org), we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  associated with complex traits (from http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) are
  significantly more likely to be eQTLs than minor-allele-frequency-matched
  SNPs chosen from high-throughput GWAS platforms. These findings are robust
  across a range of thresholds for establishing eQTLs (p-values from
  10(-4)-10(-8)), and a broad spectrum of human complex traits. Analyses of
  GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust studies confirm that annotating SNPs with a
  score reflecting the strength of the evidence that the SNP is an eQTL can
  improve the ability to discover true associations and clarify the nature of
  the mechanism driving the associations. Our results showing that
  trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs and that application of
  this information can enhance discovery of trait-associated SNPs for complex
  phenotypes raise the possibility that we can utilize this information both to
  increase the heritability explained by identifiable genetic factors and to
  gain a better understanding of the biology underlying complex traits.%

    Associations of variants located in the HLA class II region with chronic
  hepatitis B (CHB) infection have been identified in Asian populations. Here,
  HLA imputation method was applied to determine HLA alleles using genome-wide
  SNP typing data of 1,975 Japanese individuals (1,033 HBV patients and 942
  healthy controls). Together with data of an additional 1,481 Japanese healthy
  controls, association tests of six HLA loci including HLA-A, C, B, DRB1,
  DQB1, and DPB1, were performed. Although the strongest association was
  detected at a SNP located in the HLA-DP locus in a SNP-based GWAS using data
  from the 1,975 Japanese individuals, HLA genotyping-based analysis identified
  DQB1*06:01 as having the strongest association, showing a greater association
  with CHB susceptibility (OR = 1.76, P = 6.57 x 10(-18)) than any one of five
  HLA-DPB1 alleles that were previously reported as CHB susceptibility alleles.
  Moreover, HLA haplotype analysis showed that, among the five previously
  reported HLA-DPB1 susceptibility and protective alleles, the association of
  two DPB1 alleles (DPB1*09:01, and *04:01) had come from linkage
  disequilibrium with HLA-DR-DQ haplotypes, DRB1*15:02-DQB1*06:01 and
  DRB1*13:02-DQB1*06:04, respectively. The present study showed an example that
  SNP-based GWAS does not necessarily detect the primary susceptibility locus
  in the HLA region.%

    Background: Systemic reactivations of herpesviruses may occur in intensive
  care unit (ICU) patients, even in those without prior immune deficiency.
  However, the clinical relevance of these events is uncertain. Methods: In
  this study we selected patients admitted with septic shock and treated for
  more than 4 days from a prospectively enrolled cohort of consecutive adults
  in the mixed ICUs of 2 tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We
  excluded patients who had received antiviral treatment in the week before ICU
  admission and those with known immunodeficiency. We studied viremia episodes
  with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6
  (HHV-6), herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella
  zoster virus (VZV) by weekly polymerase chain reaction in plasma. Results:
  Among 329 patients, we observed 399 viremia episodes in 223 (68%) patients.
  Viremia with CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV was detected in 60 (18%),
  157 (48%), 80 (24%), 87 (26%), 13 (4%), and 2 (0.6%) patients, respectively;
  112 (34%) patients had multiple concurrent viremia events. Crude mortality in
  the ICU was 36% in this latter group compared to 19% in remaining patients (P
  < .01). After adjustment for potential confounders, time-dependent bias, and
  competing risks, only concurrent CMV and EBV reactivations remained
  independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted subdistribution
  hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-7.13). Conclusions:
  Herpesvirus reactivations were documented in 68% of septic shock patients
  without prior immunodeficiency and frequently occurred simultaneously.
  Concurrent reactivations could be independently associated with mortality.

    \field{abstract}{%
    To complete their life cycle and spread, viruses interfere with and gain
  control of diverse cellular processes, this most often occurring through
  interaction between viral proteins (VPs) and resident protein partners. Among
  the latter, Src family kinases (SFKs), a class of non-receptor tyrosine
  kinases that contributes to the conversion of extracellular signals into
  intracellular signaling cascades and is involved in virtually all cellular
  processes, have recently emerged as critical mediators between the cell's
  infrastructure and the viral demands. In this scenario, structural or ex novo
  synthesized VPs are able to bind to the different domains of these enzymes
  through specific short linear motifs present along their sequences.
  Proline-rich motifs displaying the conserved minimal consensus PxxP and
  recognizing the SFK Src homology (SH)3 domain constitute a cardinal signature
  for the formation of multiprotein complexes and this interaction may promote
  phosphorylation of VPs by SFKs, thus creating phosphotyrosine motifs that
  become a docking site for the SH2 domains of SFKs or other SH2 domain-bearing
  signaling molecules. Importantly, the formation of these assemblies also
  results in a change in the activity and/or location of SFKs, and these events
  are critical in perturbing key signaling pathways so that viruses can utilize
  the cell's machinery to their own benefit. In the light of these
  observations, although VPs as such, especially those with enzyme activity,
  are still regarded as valuable targets for therapeutic strategies,
  multiprotein complexes composed of viral and host cell proteins are
  increasingly becoming objects of investigation with a view to deeply
  characterize the structural aspects that favor their formation and to develop
  new compounds able to contrast viral diseases in an alternative manner.%

    One of the key questions in the study of mammalian gene regulation is how
  epigenetic methylation patterns on histones and DNA are initiated and
  established. These stable, heritable, covalent modifications are largely
  associated with the repression or silencing of gene transcription, and when
  deregulated can be involved in the development of human diseases such as
  cancer. This article reviews examples of viruses and bacteria known or
  thought to induce epigenetic changes in host cells, and how this might
  contribute to disease. The heritable nature of these processes in gene
  regulation suggests that they could play important roles in chronic diseases
  associated with microbial persistence; they might also explain so-called
  'hit-and-run' phenomena in infectious disease pathogenesis.%

    Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a common cause of death during influenza
  epidemics. We hypothesized that virus-specific factors could contribute to
  differences in annual excess mortality. Recombinant influenza viruses with
  neuraminidases from representative strains from the past 50 years were
  created and characterized. The specific level of their neuraminidase activity
  correlated with their ability to support secondary bacterial pneumonia.
  Recombinant viruses with neuraminidases from 1957 and 1997 influenza strains
  had the highest level of activity, whereas a virus with the neuraminidase
  from a 1968 strain had the lowest level of activity. The high level of
  activity of the neuraminidase from the 1957 strain, compared with that of
  other neuraminidases, more strongly supported the adherence of Streptococcus
  pneumoniae and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia in a mouse
  model. These data lend support to our hypothesis that the influenza virus
  neuraminidase contributes to secondary bacterial pneumonia and subsequent
  excess mortality.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Infectious and inflammatory diseases have repeatedly shown strong genetic
  associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); however, the
  basis for these associations remains elusive. To define host genetic effects
  on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide
  association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and
  progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the
  classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified >300
  genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC
  and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove,
  as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and
  reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the
  nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating
  durable control of HIV infection.%

    The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), funded as an initiative of the NIH
  Roadmap for Biomedical Research (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov), is a
  multi-component community resource. The goals of the HMP are: (1) to take
  advantage of new, high-throughput technologies to characterize the human
  microbiome more fully by studying samples from multiple body sites from each
  of at least 250 "normal" volunteers; (2) to determine whether there are
  associations between changes in the microbiome and health/disease by studying
  several different medical conditions; and (3) to provide both a standardized
  data resource and new technological approaches to enable such studies to be
  undertaken broadly in the scientific community. The ethical, legal, and
  social implications of such research are being systematically studied as
  well. The ultimate objective of the HMP is to demonstrate that there are
  opportunities to improve human health through monitoring or manipulation of
  the human microbiome. The history and implementation of this new program are
  described here.%

    BACKGROUND: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public
  health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica
  serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our
  hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide
  cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a
  rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome
  sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then
  integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing,
  thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we
  investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the
  MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital
  outbreak of Salmonella. RESULTS: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing
  can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol
  with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION
  can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes
  of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment
  to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic
  placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and
  determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: Both
  approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the
  Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such
  information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and
  influence infection control practices.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record,
  responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome
  sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious
  agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the
  identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and
  monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to
  vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in
  the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 x 10(-3) and 1.42 x
  10(-3) mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in
  each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify
  distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides
  a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after
  for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control
  measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform
  interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic
  owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical
  difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address
  this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a
  novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was
  transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time
  genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and
  analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October
  2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an
  Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60
  min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in
  resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor
  outbreaks.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Genome sequencing has become a powerful tool for studying emerging
  infectious diseases; however, genome sequencing directly from clinical
  samples (i.e., without isolation and culture) remains challenging for viruses
  such as Zika, for which metagenomic sequencing methods may generate
  insufficient numbers of viral reads. Here we present a protocol for
  generating coding-sequence-complete genomes, comprising an online primer
  design tool, a novel multiplex PCR enrichment protocol, optimized library
  preparation methods for the portable MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore
  Technologies) and the Illumina range of instruments, and a bioinformatics
  pipeline for generating consensus sequences. The MinION protocol does not
  require an Internet connection for analysis, making it suitable for field
  applications with limited connectivity. Our method relies on multiplex PCR
  for targeted enrichment of viral genomes from samples containing as few as 50
  genome copies per reaction. Viral consensus sequences can be achieved in 1-2
  d by starting with clinical samples and following a simple laboratory
  workflow. This method has been successfully used by several groups studying
  Zika virus evolution and is facilitating an understanding of the spread of
  the virus in the Americas. The protocol can be used to sequence other viral
  genomes using the online Primal Scheme primer designer software. It is
  suitable for sequencing either RNA or DNA viruses in the field during
  outbreaks or as an inexpensive, convenient method for use in the lab.%

    The highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus encodes cell
  surface proteins that are critical for immunity. HLA-A expression levels vary
  in an allele-dependent manner, diversifying allele-specific effects beyond
  peptide-binding preference. Analysis of 9763 HIV-infected individuals from 21
  cohorts shows that higher HLA-A levels confer poorer control of HIV. Elevated
  HLA-A expression provides enhanced levels of an HLA-A-derived signal peptide
  that specifically binds and determines expression levels of HLA-E, the ligand
  for the inhibitory NKG2A natural killer (NK) cell receptor. HLA-B haplotypes
  that favor NKG2A-mediated NK cell licensing (i.e., education) exacerbate the
  deleterious effect of high HLA-A on HIV control, consistent with
  NKG2A-mediated inhibition impairing NK cell clearance of HIV-infected
  targets. Therapeutic blockade of HLA-E:NKG2A interaction may yield benefit in
  HIV disease.%

    According to classical evolutionary theory, phenotypic variation originates
  from random mutations that are independent of selective pressure. However,
  recent findings suggest that organisms have evolved mechanisms to influence
  the timing or genomic location of heritable variability. Hypervariable
  contingency loci and epigenetic switches increase the variability of specific
  phenotypes; error-prone DNA replicases produce bursts of variability in times
  of stress. Interestingly, these mechanisms seem to tune the variability of a
  given phenotype to match the variability of the acting selective pressure.
  Although these observations do not undermine Darwin's theory, they suggest
  that selection and variability are less independent than once thought.%

    BACKGROUND: Sepsis continues to be a major cause of death, disability, and
  health-care expenditure worldwide. Despite evidence suggesting that host
  genetics can influence sepsis outcomes, no specific loci have yet been
  convincingly replicated. The aim of this study was to identify genetic
  variants that influence sepsis survival. METHODS: We did a genome-wide
  association study in three independent cohorts of white adult patients
  admitted to intensive care units with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock
  (as defined by the International Consensus Criteria) due to pneumonia or
  intra-abdominal infection (cohorts 1-3, n=2534 patients). The primary outcome
  was 28 day survival. Results for the cohort of patients with sepsis due to
  pneumonia were combined in a meta-analysis of 1553 patients from all three
  cohorts, of whom 359 died within 28 days of admission to the intensive-care
  unit. The most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) were genotyped in a further 538 white patients with sepsis due to
  pneumonia (cohort 4), of whom 106 died. FINDINGS: In the genome-wide
  meta-analysis of three independent pneumonia cohorts (cohorts 1-3), common
  variants in the FER gene were strongly associated with survival (p=9.7 x
  10(-8)). Further genotyping of the top associated SNP (rs4957796) in the
  additional cohort (cohort 4) resulted in a combined p value of 5.6 x 10(-8)
  (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.69). In a time-to-event analysis, each allele
  reduced the mortality over 28 days by 44% (hazard ratio for death 0.56, 95%
  CI 0.45-0.69; likelihood ratio test p=3.4 x 10(-9), after adjustment for age
  and stratification by cohort). Mortality was 9.5% in patients carrying the CC
  genotype, 15.2% in those carrying the TC genotype, and 25.3% in those
  carrying the TT genotype. No significant genetic associations were identified
  when patients with sepsis due to pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection were
  combined. INTERPRETATION: We have identified common variants in the FER gene
  that associate with a reduced risk of death from sepsis due to pneumonia. The
  FER gene and associated molecular pathways are potential novel targets for
  therapy or prevention and candidates for the development of biomarkers for
  risk stratification. FUNDING: European Commission and the Wellcome Trust.%

    BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need for more objective methods of
  identifying patients at risk for septic shock and poorer outcomes among those
  with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As viral load is useful in viral
  infections, we hypothesized that bacterial load may be associated with
  outcomes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: Quantification of
  Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA level by real-time polymerase chain reaction
  (rt-PCR) was prospectively conducted on whole-blood samples from a cohort of
  353 patients who were displaying CAP symptoms upon their admission to the ED.
  RESULTS: CAP caused by S pneumoniae was documented in 93 patients (36.5% with
  positive blood culture findings). A positive S pneumoniae rt-PCR assay
  finding was associated with a statistically significant higher mortality
  (odds ratio [OR], 7.08), risk for shock (OR, 6.29), and the need for
  mechanical ventilation (MV) [OR, 7.96]. Logistic regression, adjusted for
  age, sex, comorbidities, and pneumonia severity index class, revealed
  bacterial load as independently associated with septic shock (adjusted odds
  ratio [aOR], 2.42; 95% CI, 1.10 to 5.80) and the need for MV (aOR, 2.71; 95%
  CI, 1.17 to 6.27). An S pneumoniae bacterial load of >or= 10(3) copies per
  milliliter occurred in 29.0% of patients (27 of 93 patients; 95% CI, 20.8 to
  38.9%) being associated with a statistically significant higher risk for
  septic shock (OR, 8.00), the need for MV (OR, 10.50), and hospital mortality
  (OR, 5.43). CONCLUSION: In patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, bacterial
  load is associated with the likelihood of death, the risk of septic shock,
  and the need for MV. High genomic bacterial load for S pneumoniae may be a
  useful tool for severity assessment.%

    limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated
  solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains
  rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information
  borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past
  decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
  differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
  The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing
  and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
  significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can
  now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses
  of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools
  previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
  well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray
  data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past
  the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing
  expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of
  higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
  biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article
  reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new
  and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features
  that have not been previously described.%

    BACKGROUND: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are useful tools
  to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and bioinformatics applications.
  However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or
  insufficient statistical analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves
  analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of
  tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a
  user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface. RESULTS: With data
  previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC
  curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical
  tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating
  points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves.
  Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A
  case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to
  perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC. CONCLUSIONS: pROC is a package for
  R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes multiple
  statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas
  under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation. pROC is available in two
  versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in
  the S+ statistical software. It is accessible at
  http://expasy.org/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public License. It is
  also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public repositories, facilitating
  its installation.%

    RATIONALE: Although airway microbiota composition correlates with clinical
  measures in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, these data are unlikely to
  provide useful prognostic information at the individual patient level. A
  system enabling microbiota data to be applied clinically would represent a
  substantial translational advance. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine
  whether stratification of patients according to the predominant microbiota
  taxon can provide improved clinical insight compared with standard
  diagnostics. METHODS: The presence of bacterial respiratory pathogens was
  assessed in induced sputum from 107 adult patients by culture, quantitative
  PCR, and, in 96 samples, by ribosomal gene pyrosequencing. Prospective
  analysis was performed on samples from 42 of these patients. Microbiological
  data were correlated with concurrent clinical measures and subsequent
  outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Microbiota analysis defined three
  groups: Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated (n = 26), Haemophilus influenzae
  dominated (n = 34), and other taxa dominated (n = 36). Patients with P.
  aeruginosa- and H. influenzae-dominated communities had significantly worse
  lung function, higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and higher
  sputum levels of IL-8 and IL-1beta. Predominance of P. aeruginosa, followed
  by Veillonella species, was the best predictor of future exacerbation
  frequency, with H. influenzae-dominated communities having significantly
  fewer episodes. Detection of P. aeruginosa was associated with poor lung
  function and exacerbation frequency, irrespective of analytical strategy.
  Quantitative PCR revealed significant correlations between H. influenzae
  levels and sputum IL-8, IL-1beta, and serum CRP. Genus richness was
  negatively correlated with 24-hour sputum weight, age, serum CRP, sputum
  IL-1beta, and IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Stratification of patients with non-cystic
  fibrosis bronchiectasis on the basis of predominant bacterial taxa is more
  clinically informative than either conventional culture or quantitative
  PCR-based analysis. Further investigation is now required to assess the
  mechanistic basis of these associations.%

    INTRODUCTION: The host response to septic shock is dynamic and complex. A
  sepsis-induced immunosuppression phase has recently been acknowledged and
  linked to bad outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Moreover, a marked
  suppression of the immune response has also been partially described in
  patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe trauma or
  burns. It has been hypothesized that immune monitoring could enable
  identification of patients who might most benefit from novel, adjunctive
  immune-stimulating therapies. However, there is currently neither a clear
  definition for such injury-induced immunosuppression nor a stratification
  biomarker compatible with clinical constraints. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We set
  up a prospective, longitudinal single-centre clinical study to determine the
  incidence, severity and persistency of innate and adaptive immune alterations
  in ICU patients. We optimized a workflow to describe and follow the
  immunoinflammatory status of 550 patients (septic shock, severe trauma/burn
  and major surgery) during the first 2 months after their initial injury. On
  each time point, two immune functional tests will be performed to determine
  whole-blood TNF-alpha production in response to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide
  stimulation and the T lymphocyte proliferation in response to
  phytohaemagglutinin. In addition, a complete immunophenotyping using flow
  cytometry including monocyte HLA-DR expression and lymphocyte subsets will be
  obtained. New markers (ie, levels of expression of host mRNA and viral
  reactivation) will be also evaluated. Reference intervals will be determined
  from a cohort of 150 age-matched healthy volunteers. This clinical study will
  provide, for the first time, data describing the immune status of severe ICU
  patients over time. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been
  obtained from the institutional review board (no 69HCL15_0379) and the French
  National Security agency for drugs and health-related products. Results will
  be disseminated through presentations at scientific meetings and publications
  in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov

    OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of filgrastim
  (r-metHuG-CSF) in combination with intravenous antibiotics to reduce the rate
  of mortality in patients with pneumonia and sepsis. DESIGN: This study was
  multicenter, double-blind, and randomized. SETTING: Intensive care units
  PATIENTS Adult patients with bacterial pneumonia, either acquired or
  nosocomial, as confirmed by chest radiograph and positive culture or
  Gram-negative stain, and severe sepsis, defined as sepsis-induced hypotension
  or organ dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: Standard antibiotic therapy with or
  without filgrastim (300 microg/day) or placebo administered as a 30-min
  intravenous infusion. The study drug was started within 24 hrs of enrollment
  and was continued for 5 days or until the white blood cell count reached
  >75.0 x 10(9) cells/L. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point
  was the occurrence of mortality through day 29; secondary end points included
  occurrence of subsequent organ dysfunction, time to discharge from intensive
  care unit, number of days on mechanical ventilatory support, and time to
  death. Study-related observations were recorded through day 10 and included
  vital signs, onset of organ dysfunction, clinical laboratory variables, and
  adverse events. Filgrastim increased the white blood cell count to a median
  peak of 31.7 x 10(9) cells/L from a baseline of 12.3 x 10(9) cells/L. The two
  groups were well matched and did not differ significantly with regard to
  severe adverse events, time to death, occurrence of end-organ dysfunction,
  days of intensive care unit hospitalization, or days on mechanical
  ventilatory support. Mortality was low in both treatment groups; the
  mortality rate in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome was
  similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of filgrastim to
  the antibiotic and supportive care treatment of patients with pneumonia
  complicated by severe sepsis appeared to be safe, but not efficacious in
  reducing mortality rates or complications from this infection.%

    BACKGROUND: Prosthetic joint infections are clinically difficult to
  diagnose and treat. Previously, we demonstrated metagenomic sequencing on an
  Illumina MiSeq replicates the findings of current gold standard
  microbiological diagnostic techniques. Nanopore sequencing offers advantages
  in speed of detection over MiSeq. Here, we report a real-time analytical
  pathway for Nanopore sequence data, designed for detecting bacterial
  composition of prosthetic joint infections but potentially useful for any
  microbial sequencing, and compare detection by direct-from-clinical-sample
  metagenomic nanopore sequencing with Illumina sequencing and standard
  microbiological diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: DNA was extracted from the
  sonication fluids of seven explanted orthopaedic devices, and additionally
  from two culture negative controls, and was sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore
  Technologies MinION platform. A specific analysis pipeline was assembled to
  overcome the challenges of identifying the true infecting pathogen, given
  high levels of host contamination and unavoidable background lab and kit
  contamination. The majority of DNA classified (> 90%) was host contamination
  and discarded. Using negative control filtering thresholds, the species
  identified corresponded with both routine microbiological diagnosis and MiSeq
  results. By analysing sequences in real time, causes of infection were
  robustly detected within minutes from initiation of sequencing. CONCLUSIONS:
  We demonstrate a novel, scalable pipeline for real-time analysis of MinION
  sequence data and use of this pipeline to show initial proof of concept that
  metagenomic MinION sequencing can provide rapid, accurate diagnosis for
  prosthetic joint infections. The high proportion of human DNA in prosthetic
  joint infection extracts prevents full genome analysis from complete
  coverage, and methods to reduce this could increase genome depth and allow
  antimicrobial resistance profiling. The nine samples sequenced in this pilot
  study have shown a proof of concept for sequencing and analysis that will
  enable us to investigate further sequencing to improve specificity and
  sensitivity.%

    Sepsis is the dysregulated host response to an infection which leads to
  life-threatening organ dysfunction that varies by host genomic factors. We
  conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 740 adult septic patients
  and focused on 28day mortality as outcome. Variants with suggestive evidence
  for an association (p</=10(-5)) were validated in two additional GWA studies
  (n=3470) and gene coding regions related to the variants were assessed in an
  independent exome sequencing study (n=74). In the discovery GWAS, we
  identified 243 autosomal variants which clustered in 14 loci (p</=10(-5)).
  The best association signal (rs117983287; p=8.16x10(-8)) was observed for a
  missense variant located at chromosome 9q21.2 in the VPS13A gene. VPS13A was
  further supported by additional GWAS (p=0.03) and sequencing data (p=0.04).
  Furthermore, CRISPLD2 (p=5.99x10(-6)) and a region on chromosome 13q21.33
  (p=3.34x10(-7)) were supported by both our data and external biological
  evidence. We found 14 loci with suggestive evidence for an association with
  28day mortality and found supportive, converging evidence for three of them
  in independent data sets. Elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms of
  VPS13A, CRISPLD2, and the chromosome 13 locus should be a focus of future
  research activities.%

    Treponema pallidum infections occur worldwide causing, among other
  diseases, syphilis and yaws. In particular sexually transmitted syphilis is
  regarded as a re-emerging infectious disease with millions of new infections
  annually. Here we present three historic T. pallidum genomes (two from T.
  pallidum ssp. pallidum and one from T. pallidum ssp. pertenue) that have been
  reconstructed from skeletons recovered from the Convent of Santa Isabel in
  Mexico City, operational between the 17th and 19th century. Our analyses
  indicate that different T. pallidum subspecies caused similar diagnostic
  presentations that are normally associated with syphilis in infants, and
  potential evidence of a congenital infection of T. pallidum ssp. pertenue,
  the causative agent of yaws. This first reconstruction of T. pallidum genomes
  from archaeological material opens the possibility of studying its
  evolutionary history at a resolution previously assumed to be out of reach.%

    BACKGROUND: Host responses during sepsis are highly heterogeneous, which
  hampers the identification of patients at high risk of mortality and their
  selection for targeted therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify
  biologically relevant molecular endotypes in patients with sepsis. METHODS:
  This was a prospective observational cohort study that included consecutive
  patients admitted for sepsis to two intensive care units (ICUs) in the
  Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and July 20, 2012 (discovery and first
  validation cohorts) and patients admitted with sepsis due to
  community-acquired pneumonia to 29 ICUs in the UK (second validation cohort).
  We generated genome-wide blood gene expression profiles from admission
  samples and analysed them by unsupervised consensus clustering and machine
  learning. The primary objective of this study was to establish endotypes for
  patients with sepsis, and assess the association of these endotypes with
  clinical traits and survival outcomes. We also established candidate
  biomarkers for the endotypes to allow identification of patient endotypes in
  clinical practice. FINDINGS: The discovery cohort had 306 patients, the first
  validation cohort had 216, and the second validation cohort had 265 patients.
  Four molecular endotypes for sepsis, designated Mars1-4, were identified in
  the discovery cohort, and were associated with 28-day mortality (log-rank
  p=0.022). In the discovery cohort, the worst outcome was found for patients
  classified as having a Mars1 endotype, and at 28 days, 35 (39%) of 90 people
  with a Mars1 endotype had died (hazard ratio [HR] vs all other endotypes 1.86
  [95% CI 1.21-2.86]; p=0.0045), compared with 23 (22%) of 105 people with a
  Mars2 endotype (HR 0.64 [0.40-1.04]; p=0.061), 16 (23%) of 71 people with a
  Mars3 endotype (HR 0.71 [0.41-1.22]; p=0.19), and 13 (33%) of 40 patients
  with a Mars4 endotype (HR 1.13 [0.63-2.04]; p=0.69). Analysis of the net
  reclassification improvement using a combined clinical and endotype model
  significantly improved risk prediction to 0.33 (0.09-0.58; p=0.008). A
  140-gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with sepsis to the
  four endotypes in both the first and second validation cohorts. Only Mars1
  was consistently significantly associated with 28-day mortality across the
  cohorts. To facilitate possible clinical use, a biomarker was derived for
  each endotype; BPGM and TAP2 reliably identified patients with a Mars1
  endotype. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a method for the molecular
  classification of patients with sepsis to four different endotypes upon ICU
  admission. Detection of sepsis endotypes might assist in providing
  personalised patient management and in selection for trials. FUNDING: Center
  for Translational Molecular Medicine, Netherlands.%

    BACKGROUND: In 2013, New York began requiring hospitals to follow protocols
  for the early identification and treatment of sepsis. However, there is
  controversy about whether more rapid treatment of sepsis improves outcomes in
  patients. METHODS: We studied data from patients with sepsis and septic shock
  that were reported to the New York State Department of Health from April 1,
  2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients had a sepsis protocol initiated within 6
  hours after arrival in the emergency department and had all items in a 3-hour
  bundle of care for patients with sepsis (i.e., blood cultures, broad-spectrum
  antibiotic agents, and lactate measurement) completed within 12 hours.
  Multilevel models were used to assess the associations between the time until
  completion of the 3-hour bundle and risk-adjusted mortality. We also examined
  the times to the administration of antibiotics and to the completion of an
  initial bolus of intravenous fluid. RESULTS: Among 49,331 patients at 149
  hospitals, 40,696 (82.5%) had the 3-hour bundle completed within 3 hours. The
  median time to completion of the 3-hour bundle was 1.30 hours (interquartile
  range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the administration of antibiotics
  was 0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), and the median time to
  completion of the fluid bolus was 2.56 hours (interquartile range, 1.33 to
  4.20). Among patients who had the 3-hour bundle completed within 12 hours, a
  longer time to the completion of the bundle was associated with higher
  risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95%
  confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; P<0.001), as was a longer time to the
  administration of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% CI, 1.03 to
  1.06; P<0.001) but not a longer time to the completion of a bolus of
  intravenous fluids (odds ratio, 1.01 per hour; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02; P=0.21).
  CONCLUSIONS: More rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and
  rapid administration of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial
  bolus of intravenous fluids, were associated with lower risk-adjusted
  in-hospital mortality. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and
  others.).%

    Agnostic metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a
  promising single, universal pathogen detection method for infectious disease
  diagnostics. This methodology allows for identification and genomic
  characterization of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses without the need
  for a priori knowledge of a specific pathogen directly from clinical
  specimens. Although there are increasing reports of mNGS successes, several
  hurdles need to be addressed, such as differentiation of colonization from
  infection, extraneous sources of nucleic acid, method standardization, and
  data storage, protection, analysis, and interpretation. As more commercial
  and clinical microbiology laboratories develop mNGS assays, it is important
  for treating practitioners to understand both the power and limitations of
  this method as a diagnostic tool for infectious diseases.%

    IMPORTANCE: Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in
  2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology
  (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry,
  immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis,
  suggesting the need for reexamination. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and, as needed,
  update definitions for sepsis and septic shock. PROCESS: A task force (n =
  19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology
  was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European
  Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were
  generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health
  record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international
  professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31
  societies listed in the Acknowledgment). KEY FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE
  SYNTHESIS: Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on
  inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through
  severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the
  systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions
  and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ
  dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed
  mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.
  RECOMMENDATIONS: Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ
  dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical
  operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in
  the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2
  points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater
  than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which
  particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are
  associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients
  with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement
  to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate
  level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This
  combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In
  out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings,
  adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being
  more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2
  of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside
  clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or
  greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.
  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These updated definitions and clinical criteria
  should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for
  epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition
  and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing
  sepsis.%

    To assess genetic and environmental influences on adult mortality, we
  followed 960 families that included children born during the period 1924
  through 1926 who were placed early in life with adoptive parents unrelated to
  them. We evaluated the risks of dying from all causes or from specific groups
  of causes between the ages of 16 and 58 years for adoptees with a biologic or
  adoptive parent who died of the same cause before the age of either 50 or 70.
  We compared these risks with the adoptees' risk of dying from the same causes
  between the ages of 16 and 58 when either the biologic or adoptive parents
  were still alive at the ages of 50 and 70. The death of a biologic parent
  before the age of 50 resulted in relative risks of death in the adoptees of
  1.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.14 to 2.57) for all causes, 1.98
  (1.25 to 3.12) for natural causes, 5.81 (2.47 to 13.7) for infections, 4.52
  (1.32 to 15.4) for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular causes, and 1.19 (0.16
  to 8.99) for cancers. The death of an adoptive parent resulted in relative
  risks of death in the adoptees that were close to unity for all causes,
  natural causes, and infections, 3.02 (0.72 to 12.8) for vascular causes, and
  5.16 (1.20 to 22.2) for cancers. A similar but weaker pattern was observed
  when either a biologic or adoptive parent died before the age of 70. We
  conclude that premature death in adults has a strong genetic
  background--especially death due to infections and vascular causes.(ABSTRACT

    BACKGROUND: Next-generation 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing is widely
  used to determine the relative composition of the mammalian gut microbiomes.
  However, in the absence of a reference, this does not reveal alterations in
  absolute abundance of specific operational taxonomic units if microbial loads
  vary across specimens. RESULTS: Here we suggest the spiking of exogenous
  bacteria into crude specimens to quantify ratios of absolute bacterial
  abundances. We use the 16S rDNA read counts of the spike-in bacteria to
  adjust the read counts of endogenous bacteria for changes in total microbial
  loads. Using a series of dilutions of pooled faecal samples from mice
  containing defined amounts of the spike-in bacteria Salinibacter ruber,
  Rhizobium radiobacter and Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus, we demonstrate that
  spike-in-based calibration to microbial loads allows accurate estimation of
  ratios of absolute endogenous bacteria abundances. Applied to stool specimens
  of patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we were able to
  determine changes in both relative and absolute abundances of various phyla,
  especially the genus Enterococcus, in response to antibiotic treatment and
  radio-chemotherapeutic conditioning. CONCLUSION: Exogenous spike-in bacteria
  in gut microbiome studies enable estimation of ratios of absolute OTU
  abundances, providing novel insights into the structure and the dynamics of
  intestinal microbiomes.%

    Although several dozen studies of gene expression in sepsis have been
  published, distinguishing sepsis from a sterile systemic inflammatory
  response syndrome (SIRS) is still largely up to clinical suspicion. We
  hypothesized that a multicohort analysis of the publicly available sepsis
  gene expression data sets would yield a robust set of genes for
  distinguishing patients with sepsis from patients with sterile inflammation.
  A comprehensive search for gene expression data sets in sepsis identified 27
  data sets matching our inclusion criteria. Five data sets (n = 663 samples)
  compared patients with sterile inflammation (SIRS/trauma) to time-matched
  patients with infections. We applied our multicohort analysis framework that
  uses both effect sizes and P values in a leave-one-data set-out fashion to
  these data sets. We identified 11 genes that were differentially expressed
  (false discovery rate </=1%, inter-data set heterogeneity P > 0.01, summary
  effect size >1.5-fold) across all discovery cohorts with excellent diagnostic
  power [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
  0.87; range, 0.7 to 0.98]. We then validated these 11 genes in 15 independent
  cohorts comparing (i) time-matched infected versus noninfected trauma
  patients (4 cohorts), (ii) ICU/trauma patients with infections over the
  clinical time course (3 cohorts), and (iii) healthy subjects versus sepsis
  patients (8 cohorts). In the discovery Glue Grant cohort, SIRS plus the
  11-gene set improved prediction of infection (compared to SIRS alone) with a
  continuous net reclassification index of 0.90. Overall, multicohort analysis
  of time-matched cohorts yielded 11 genes that robustly distinguish sterile
  inflammation from infectious inflammation.%

    Improved diagnostics for acute infections could decrease morbidity and
  mortality by increasing early antibiotics for patients with bacterial
  infections and reducing unnecessary antibiotics for patients without
  bacterial infections. Several groups have used gene expression microarrays to
  build classifiers for acute infections, but these have been hampered by the
  size of the gene sets, use of overfit models, or lack of independent
  validation. We used multicohort analysis to derive a set of seven genes for
  robust discrimination of bacterial and viral infections, which we then
  validated in 30 independent cohorts. We next used our previously published
  11-gene Sepsis MetaScore together with the new bacterial/viral classifier to
  build an integrated antibiotics decision model. In a pooled analysis of 1057
  samples from 20 cohorts (excluding infants), the integrated antibiotics
  decision model had a sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infections of
  94.0 and 59.8%, respectively (negative likelihood ratio, 0.10). Prospective
  clinical validation will be needed before these findings are implemented for

    Host response biomarkers can accurately distinguish between influenza and
  bacterial infection. However, published biomarkers require the measurement of
  many genes, thereby making it difficult to implement them in clinical
  practice. This study aims to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high
  diagnostic accuracy equivalent to multi-gene biomarkers.In this study, we
  combined an integrated genomic analysis of 1071 individuals with in vitro
  experiments using well-established infection models.We identified a
  single-gene biomarker, IFI27, which had a high prediction accuracy (91%)
  equivalent to that obtained by multi-gene biomarkers. In vitro studies showed
  that IFI27 was upregulated by TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
  antigen-presenting cells that responded to influenza virus rather than
  bacteria. In vivo studies confirmed that IFI27 was expressed in influenza
  patients but not in bacterial infection, as demonstrated in multiple patient
  cohorts (n=521). In a large prospective study (n=439) of patients presented
  with undifferentiated respiratory illness (aetiologies included viral,
  bacterial and non-infectious conditions), IFI27 displayed 88% diagnostic
  accuracy (AUC) and 90% specificity in discriminating between influenza and
  bacterial infections.IFI27 represents a significant step forward in
  overcoming a translational barrier in applying genomic assay in clinical
  setting; its implementation may improve the diagnosis and management of
  respiratory infection.%

    OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether the host response of gram-positive sepsis
  differs from gram-negative sepsis at a transcriptome level. Using microarray
  technology, we compared the gene-expression profiles of gram-positive sepsis
  and gram-negative sepsis in critically ill patients. DESIGN: A prospective
  cross-sectional study. SETTING: A 20-bed general intensive care unit of a
  tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-two patients admitted to the
  intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous blood was collected for
  leukocyte separation and RNA extraction. Microarray experiments were then
  performed examining the expression level of 18,664 genes in each sample.
  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no difference in the expression
  profile between gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis. The finding remained
  unchanged even when genes with lower expression level were included or after
  statistical stringency was lowered. There were, however, 94 genes
  differentially expressed between sepsis and control patients. These genes
  included those involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and mitochondrial
  function. Hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed that the difference in gene
  expression profile existed between sepsis and control patients but not
  between gram-positive and gram-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive
  sepsis and gram-negative sepsis share a common host response at a
  transcriptome level. These findings support the hypothesis that the septic
  response is nonspecific and is designed to provide a more general response
  that can be elicited by a wide range of different microorganisms.%

    The intestinal microbiome is a signalling hub that integrates environmental
  inputs, such as diet, with genetic and immune signals to affect the host's
  metabolism, immunity and response to infection. The haematopoietic and
  non-haematopoietic cells of the innate immune system are located
  strategically at the host-microbiome interface. These cells have the ability

    Acute respiratory infections caused by bacterial or viral pathogens are
  among the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Despite improvements
  in pathogen-based diagnostics, most patients receive inappropriate
  antibiotics. Host response biomarkers offer an alternative diagnostic
  approach to direct antimicrobial use. This observational cohort study
  determined whether host gene expression patterns discriminate noninfectious
  from infectious illness and bacterial from viral causes of acute respiratory
  infection in the acute care setting. Peripheral whole blood gene expression
  from 273 subjects with community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or
  noninfectious illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using
  microarrays. Sparse logistic regression was used to develop classifiers for
  bacterial ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of
  illness (26 probes). Overall accuracy was 87% (238 of 273 concordant with
  clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than procalcitonin (78%, P <
  0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection (78
  to 83%). The classifiers developed here externally validated in five publicly
  available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A sixth publicly available data set
  included 25 patients with co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens.
  Applying the ARI classifiers defined four distinct groups: a host response to
  bacterial ARI, viral ARI, coinfection, and neither a bacterial nor a viral
  response. These findings create an opportunity to develop and use host gene
  expression classifiers as diagnostic platforms to combat inappropriate
  antibiotic use and emerging antibiotic resistance.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The concept of pathogenesis has evolved considerably over recent years, and
  the scenario "a microbe + virulence factors = disease" is probably far from
  reality in a number of cases. Actual pathogens have extremely broad
  biological diversity and are found in all major groups of microorganisms
  (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa...). Their pathogenicity results from
  strong and often highly specific interactions they have with either their
  microbial environment, hosts and/or arthropod vectors. In this review, we
  explore the contribution of metagenomic approaches toward understanding
  pathogens within the context of microbial communities. With this broader
  view, we discussed the concept of "pathobiome" and the research questions
  that this raises.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    BACKGROUND: Global epidemiological data regarding outcomes for patients in
  intensive care units (ICUs) are scarce, but are important in understanding
  the worldwide burden of critical illness. We, therefore, did an international
  audit of ICU patients worldwide and assessed variations between hospitals and
  countries in terms of ICU mortality. METHODS: 730 participating centres in 84
  countries prospectively collected data on all adult (>16 years) patients
  admitted to their ICU between May 8 and May 18, 2012, except those admitted
  for fewer than 24 h for routine postoperative monitoring. Participation was
  voluntary. Data were collected daily for a maximum of 28 days in the ICU and
  patients were followed up for outcome data until death or hospital discharge.
  In-hospital death was analysed using multilevel logistic regression with
  three levels: patient, hospital, and country. FINDINGS: 10,069 patients were
  included from ICUs in Europe (5445 patients; 54.1%), Asia (1928; 19.2%), the
  Americas (1723; 17.1%), Oceania (439; 4.4%), the Middle East (393; 3.9%), and
  Africa (141; 1.4%). Overall, 2973 patients (29.5%) had sepsis on admission or
  during the ICU stay. ICU mortality rates were 16.2% (95% CI 15.5-16.9) across
  the whole population and 25.8% (24.2-27.4) in patients with sepsis. Hospital
  mortality rates were 22.4% (21.6-23.2) in the whole population and 35.3%
  (33.5-37.1) in patients with sepsis. Using a multilevel analysis, the
  unconditional model suggested significant between-country variations
  (var=0.19, p=0.002) and between-hospital variations (var=0.43, p<0.0001) in
  the individual risk of in-hospital death. There was a stepwise increase in
  the adjusted risk of in-hospital death according to decrease in global
  national income. INTERPRETATION: This large database highlights that sepsis
  remains a major health problem worldwide, associated with high mortality
  rates in all countries. Our findings also show a significant association
  between the risk of death and the global national income and suggest that ICU
  organisation has an important effect on risk of death. FUNDING: None.%

    The rising incidence of invasive fungal infections and the expanding
  spectrum of fungal pathogens makes early and accurate identification of the
  causative pathogen a daunting task. Diagnostics using molecular markers
  enable rapid identification of fungi, offer new insights into infectious
  disease dynamics, and open new possibilities for infectious disease control
  and prevention. We performed a retrospective study using clinical specimens
  (N = 233) from patients with suspected fungal infection previously subjected
  to culture and/or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR. We used these
  specimens to evaluate a high-throughput screening method for fungal detection
  using automated DNA extraction (QIASymphony), fungal ribosomal small subunit
  (18S) rDNA RT-PCR and amplicon sequencing. Fungal sequences were compared
  with sequences from the curated, commercially available SmartGene IDNS
  database for pathogen identification. Concordance between 18S rDNA RT-PCR and
  culture results was 91%, and congruence between 18S rDNA RT-PCR and ITS PCR
  results was 94%. In addition, 18S rDNA RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing detected
  fungal pathogens in culture negative (N = 13) and ITS PCR negative specimens
  (N = 12) from patients with a clinically confirmed fungal infection. Our
  results support the use of the 18S rDNA RT-PCR diagnostic workflow for rapid
  and accurate identification of fungal pathogens in clinical specimens.%

    A current controversy is whether patients with sepsis progress to an
  immunosuppressed state. We hypothesized that reactivation of latent viruses
  occurred with prolonged sepsis thereby providing evidence of
  clinically-relevant immunosuppression and potentially providing a means to
  serially-monitor patients' immune status. Secondly, if viral loads are
  markedly elevated, they may contribute to morbidity and mortality. This study
  determined if reactivation of herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and the
  anellovirus TTV occurred in sepsis and correlated with severity. Serial whole
  blood and plasma samples from 560 critically-ill septic, 161 critically-ill
  non-septic, and 164 healthy age-matched patients were analyzed by
  quantitative-polymerase-chain-reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV),
  Epstein-Barr (EBV), herpes-simplex (HSV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and
  TTV. Polyomaviruses BK and JC were quantitated in urine. Detectable virus was
  analyzed with respect to secondary fungal and opportunistic bacterial
  infections, ICU duration, severity of illness, and survival. Patients with
  protracted sepsis had markedly increased frequency of detectable virus.
  Cumulative viral DNA detection rates in blood were: CMV (24.2%), EBV (53.2%),
  HSV (14.1%), HHV-6 (10.4%), and TTV (77.5%). 42.7% of septic patients had
  presence of two or more viruses. The 50% detection rate for herpesviruses was
  5-8 days after sepsis onset. A small subgroup of septic patients had markedly
  elevated viral loads (>104-106 DNA copies/ml blood) for CMV, EBV, and HSV.
  Excluding TTV, DNAemia was uncommon in critically-ill non-septic patients and
  in age-matched healthy controls. Compared to septic patients without DNAemia,
  septic patients with viremia had increased fungal and opportunistic bacterial
  infections. Patients with detectable CMV in plasma had higher 90-day
  mortality compared to CMV-negative patients; p<0.05. Reactivation of latent
  viruses is common with prolonged sepsis, with frequencies similar to those
  occurring in transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy and consistent
  with development of an immunosuppressive state. Whether reactivated latent
  viruses contribute to morbidity and mortality in sepsis remains unknown.%

    BACKGROUND: Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as biomarkers for many
  kinds of diseases, and some are even better than current indicators. The aim
  of this study was to investigate a diagnostic role for serum miRNAs in sepsis
  patients. METHODS: We recruited 166 patients with sepsis and 24 normal
  controls. Blood samples for these patients were obtained upon their admission
  in intensive care units of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The expression
  levels of miR-223, miR-15b, miR-483-5p, miR-499-5p, miR-122, and miR-193b*
  were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
  reaction assays. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-223 were significantly
  higher in patients with mild sepsis (p < 0.001) and patients with severe
  sepsis and septic shock (p < 0.001) than in normal controls, and levels of
  miR-499-5p, miR-122, and miR-193b* were significantly lower than in normal
  controls. In addition, only miR-223 (p = 0.035) and miR-499-5p (p < 0.001)
  were significantly different between patients with mild sepsis and patients
  with severe sepsis and septic shock. miR-499-5p had the highest area under a
  receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.686 (95% confidence interval,
  0.592-0.779). In addition, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (p <
  0.001), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (p < 0.001),
  and procalcitonin levels (p < 0.001) also could distinguish a mild sepsis
  group from a severe sepsis and septic shock group. In a binary logistic
  regression model, only miR-499-5p and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
  scores had good diagnostic values to distinguish between mild sepsis and
  severe sepsis and septic shock. CONCLUSION: Four serum miRNAs were identified
  as novel biomarkers of sepsis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, diagnostic study.%

    OBJECTIVE: Current biomarkers cannot completely distinguish sepsis from
  systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by other non-infectious
  diseases. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for several
  diseases, but their correlation with sepsis is not totally clarified.
  METHODS: Seven miRNAs related to inflammation or infection were included in
  the present study. Serum miRNA expression was investigated in 50 patients
  diagnosed with sepsis, 30 patients with SIRS and 20 healthy controls to
  evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value. Expression levels of serum
  miRNAs were determined by quantitative PCR using the Qiagen miScript system.
  Serum CRP and IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent
  assay. RESULTS: Serum miR-146a and miR-223 were significantly reduced in
  septic patients compared with SIRS patients and healthy controls. The areas
  under the receiver operating characteristic curve of miR-146a, miR-223 and
  IL-6 were 0.858, 0.804 and 0.785, respectively. CONCLUSION: Serum miR-146a
  and miR-223 might serve as new biomarkers for sepsis with high specificity
  and sensitivity. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00862290.).%

    Prompt identification of causative pathogenic bacteria is imperative for
  the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases, including
  sepsis and pneumonia. However, current culture-based methodologies have
  several drawbacks including their limitation of use to culturable bacterial
  species. To circumvent these problems, we attempted to detect bacterial DNA
  in blood using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology. We conducted
  metagenomic and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing of DNA
  extracted from bacteria-spiked blood using an Ion Personal Genome Machine.
  NGS data was analyzed using our in-house pipeline Genome Search Toolkit and
  database GenomeSync. The metagenomic sequencing analysis successfully
  detected three gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria spiked in the
  blood, which was associated with a significant portion of non-bacterial
  reads, even though human blood cells were separated by low-speed
  centrifugation prior to DNA extraction. Sequencing analysis of seven variable
  regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon also successfully detected all six
  bacteria spiked in the blood. The methodology using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
  analysis was verified using DNA from the blood of six patients with sepsis
  and four healthy volunteers with potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood
  being identified at the species level. These findings suggest that our system
  will be a potential platform for practical diagnosis in the future.%

    OBJECTIVE: Intravenous immunoglobulin as an adjunctive treatment in sepsis
  was regarded as promising by a Cochrane meta-analysis of smaller trials. In
  this phase III multicenter trial, we assessed whether intravenous
  immunoglobulin G (ivIgG) reduced 28-day mortality and improved morbidity in
  patients with score-defined severe sepsis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
  placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-three medical and
  surgical intensive care units in university centers and large teaching
  hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients (n = 653) with score-defined sepsis (sepsis
  score 12-27) and score-defined sepsis-induced severity of disease (Acute
  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 20-35). INTERVENTIONS:
  Patients were assigned to receive either placebo or ivIgG (day 0, 0.6 g/kg
  body weight; day 1, 0.3 g/kg body weight). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The
  prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause after 28
  days. Prospectively defined secondary end points were 7-day all-cause
  mortality, short-term change in morbidity, and pulmonary function at day 4.
  Six hundred fifty-three patients from 23 active centers formed the
  intention-to-treat group, 624 patients the per-protocol group (placebo group,
  n = 303; ivIgG group, n = 321). The 28-day mortality rate was 37.3% in the
  placebo group and 39.3% in the ivIgG group and thus not significantly
  different (p = .6695). Seven-day mortality was not reduced, and 4-day
  pulmonary function was not improved. Drug-related adverse events were rare in
  both groups. Exploratory findings revealed a 3-day shortening of mechanical
  ventilation in the surviving patients and no effect of ivIgG on plasma levels
  of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II. CONCLUSIONS:
  In patients with score-defined severe sepsis, ivIgG with a total dose of 0.9
  g/kg body weight does not reduce mortality.%

    BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) has the potential to identify a broad range of pathogens in a
  single test. METHODS: In a 1-year, multicenter, prospective study, we
  investigated the usefulness of metagenomic NGS of CSF for the diagnosis of
  infectious meningitis and encephalitis in hospitalized patients. All positive
  tests for pathogens on metagenomic NGS were confirmed by orthogonal
  laboratory testing. Physician feedback was elicited by teleconferences with a
  clinical microbial sequencing board and by surveys. Clinical effect was
  evaluated by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: We enrolled 204 pediatric
  and adult patients at eight hospitals. Patients were severely ill: 48.5% had
  been admitted to the intensive care unit, and the 30-day mortality among all
  study patients was 11.3%. A total of 58 infections of the nervous system were
  diagnosed in 57 patients (27.9%). Among these 58 infections, metagenomic NGS
  identified 13 (22%) that were not identified by clinical testing at the
  source hospital. Among the remaining 45 infections (78%), metagenomic NGS
  made concurrent diagnoses in 19. Of the 26 infections not identified by
  metagenomic NGS, 11 were diagnosed by serologic testing only, 7 were
  diagnosed from tissue samples other than CSF, and 8 were negative on
  metagenomic NGS owing to low titers of pathogens in CSF. A total of 8 of 13
  diagnoses made solely by metagenomic NGS had a likely clinical effect, with 7
  of 13 guiding treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Routine microbiologic testing is often
  insufficient to detect all neuroinvasive pathogens. In this study,
  metagenomic NGS of CSF obtained from patients with meningitis or encephalitis
  improved diagnosis of neurologic infections and provided actionable
  information in some cases. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and
  others; PDAID ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02910037.).%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Apart from beta-catenin accumulation, loss of 3p21 is one of the most
  frequent genetic alterations in numerous malignancies including
  nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Herein, we characterized a novel candidate
  tumor suppressor gene (TSG) CACNA2D3, a voltage-dependent subunit alpha 2
  delta 3 of a calcium channel complex. Downregulation of CACNA2D3 was
  frequently detected in primary NPCs and NPC cell lines compared with their
  nontumorigenic counterparts. Attenuated CACNA2D3 expression may be associated
  with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic single-nucleotide
  polymorphism sites (rs589281, rs1449325 and rs6797113) and/or epigenetic
  silencing by methylation and histone deacetylation. Given the extensive
  effects of calcium in cancer, we then investigated the tumor suppressive role
  and underlying mechanism of CACNA2D3 in the development and progression of
  NPC. CACNA2D3 was stably transfected into NPC cell lines (C666 and SUNE1) at
  levels comparative with the normal nasopharynx, alongside siRNA-mediated
  silencing in an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line (NP69) to
  conduct in vivo and in vitro functional assays. Our findings show that
  CACNA2D3-mediated increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) can induce
  mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and activation of NLK (through the Wnt/Ca2+
  pathway) to antagonize Wnt signaling-mediated anchorage-dependent and
  independent cell proliferation (via CCND1 and CMYC), invasion (via MMP7) and
  epithelial-to-mesynchemal transition (via SNAIL). As the expression pattern
  of calcium channels and their degree of functionality can change with the
  progression of cancer, CACNA2D3 may indeed be a promising biomarker for NPC.
  Our study also warrants further exploration in the potential therapeutic use
  of existing epigenetic targeting drugs (e.g., 5-azacytidine, SAHA) to
  reconstitute CACNA2D3-associated tumor suppression in NPC.%

    We assessed gene expression profiles in 2,752 twins, using a classic twin
  design to quantify expression heritability and quantitative trait loci
  (eQTLs) in peripheral blood. The most highly heritable genes ( approximately
  777) were grouped into distinct expression clusters, enriched in gene-poor
  regions, associated with specific gene function or ontology classes, and
  strongly associated with disease designation. The design enabled a comparison
  of twin-based heritability to estimates based on dizygotic
  identity-by-descent sharing and distant genetic relatedness. Consideration of
  sampling variation suggests that previous heritability estimates have been
  upwardly biased. Genotyping of 2,494 twins enabled powerful identification of
  eQTLs, which we further examined in a replication set of 1,895 unrelated
  subjects. A large number of non-redundant local eQTLs (6,756) met replication
  criteria, whereas a relatively small number of distant eQTLs (165) met
  quality control and replication standards. Our results provide a new resource
  toward understanding the genetic control of transcription.%

    Commensal microbes can have a substantial impact on autoimmune disorders,
  but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely
  unexplored. We report that autoimmune arthritis was strongly attenuated in
  the K/BxN mouse model under germ-free (GF) conditions, accompanied by
  reductions in serum autoantibody titers, splenic autoantibody-secreting
  cells, germinal centers, and the splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell population.
  Neutralization of interleukin-17 prevented arthritis development in
  specific-pathogen-free K/BxN mice resulting from a direct effect of this
  cytokine on B cells to inhibit germinal center formation. The systemic
  deficiencies of the GF animals reflected a loss of Th17 cells from the small
  intestinal lamina propria. Introduction of a single gut-residing species,
  segmented filamentous bacteria, into GF animals reinstated the lamina propria
  Th17 cell compartment and production of autoantibodies, and arthritis rapidly
  ensued. Thus, a single commensal microbe, via its ability to promote a
  specific Th cell subset, can drive an autoimmune disease.%

    Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for
  characterizing viral populations. It is culture independent, requires no a
  priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic
  information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient
  data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture
  panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from
  34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed
  approximately 1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into <200 million bp
  of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We
  compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS
  following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples,
  one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and
  one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We
  detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10
  families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following
  capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads
  post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1%
  to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second
  set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus
  sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral
  sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture
  probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses
  and has utility for research and clinical applications.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils provide immune protection against
  pathogens, but may also promote tissue injury in inflammatory diseases.
  Although neutrophils are generally considered to be a relatively homogeneous
  population, evidence for heterogeneity is emerging. Under steady-state
  conditions, neutrophil heterogeneity may arise from ageing and replenishment
  by newly released neutrophils from the bone marrow. Aged neutrophils
  upregulate CXCR4, a receptor allowing their clearance in the bone marrow,
  with feedback inhibition of neutrophil production via the IL-17/G-CSF axis,
  and rhythmic modulation of the haematopoietic stem-cell niche. The aged
  subset also expresses low levels of L-selectin. Previous studies have
  suggested that in vitro-aged neutrophils exhibit impaired migration and
  reduced pro-inflammatory properties. Here, using in vivo ageing analyses in
  mice, we show that neutrophil pro-inflammatory activity correlates positively
  with their ageing whilst in circulation. Aged neutrophils represent an overly
  active subset exhibiting enhanced alphaMbeta2 integrin activation and
  neutrophil extracellular trap formation under inflammatory conditions.
  Neutrophil ageing is driven by the microbiota via Toll-like receptor and
  myeloid differentiation factor 88-mediated signalling pathways. Depletion of
  the microbiota significantly reduces the number of circulating aged
  neutrophils and dramatically improves the pathogenesis and
  inflammation-related organ damage in models of sickle-cell disease or
  endotoxin-induced septic shock. These results identify a role for the
  microbiota in regulating a disease-promoting neutrophil subset.%

    BACKGROUND: The narrow host range of Mycobacterium leprae and the fact that
  it is refractory to growth in culture has limited research on and the
  biologic understanding of leprosy. Host genetic factors are thought to
  influence susceptibility to infection as well as disease progression.
  METHODS: We performed a two-stage genomewide association study by genotyping
  706 patients and 1225 controls using the Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina).
  We then tested three independent replication sets for an association between
  the presence of leprosy and 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
  were most strongly associated with the disease in the genomewide association
  study. Together, these replication sets comprised 3254 patients and 5955
  controls. We also carried out tests of heterogeneity of the associations (or
  lack thereof) between these 93 SNPs and disease, stratified according to
  clinical subtype (multibacillary vs. paucibacillary). RESULTS: We observed a
  significant association (P<1.00x10(-10)) between SNPs in the genes CCDC122,
  C13orf31, NOD2, TNFSF15, HLA-DR, and RIPK2 and a trend toward an association
  (P=5.10x10(-5)) with a SNP in LRRK2. The associations between the SNPs in
  C13orf31, LRRK2, NOD2, and RIPK2 and multibacillary leprosy were stronger
  than the associations between these SNPs and paucibacillary leprosy.
  CONCLUSIONS: Variants of genes in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (which
  regulates the innate immune response) are associated with susceptibility to
  infection with M. leprae.%

    We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide
  association study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort
  of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls.
  Concordance was observed between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting
  overlap in the abundance and function of species at different body sites.
  Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it
  was partially resolved after RA treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or
  saliva microbiome distinguished individuals with RA from healthy controls,
  were correlated with clinical measures and could be used to stratify
  individuals on the basis of their response to therapy. In particular,
  Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at all three sites and
  negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies, whereas
  Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at all
  three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA.
  Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron,
  sulfur, zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with
  RA. Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable.
  Our results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in
  individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome
  composition for prognosis and diagnosis.%
