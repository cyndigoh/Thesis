  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Ocular infections remain a major cause of blindness and morbidity worldwide. While prognosis is dependent on the timing and accuracy of diagnosis, the etiology remains elusive in ~50 % of presumed infectious uveitis cases. The objective of this study is to determine if unbiased metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) can accurately detect pathogens in intraocular fluid samples of patients with uveitis. METHODS: This is a proof-of-concept study, in which intraocular fluid samples were obtained from five subjects with known diagnoses, and one subject with bilateral chronic uveitis without a known etiology. Samples were subjected to MDS, and results were compared with those from conventional diagnostic tests. Pathogens were identified using a rapid computational pipeline to analyze the non-host sequences obtained from MDS. RESULTS: Unbiased MDS of intraocular fluid produced results concordant with known diagnoses in subjects with (n = 4) and without (n = 1) uveitis. Samples positive for Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii, and herpes simplex virus 1 as tested by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory were correctly identified with MDS. Rubella virus was identified in one case of chronic bilateral idiopathic uveitis. The subject's strain was most closely related to a German rubella virus strain isolated in 1992, one year before he developed a fever and rash while living in Germany. The pattern and the number of viral identified mutations present in the patient's strain were consistent with long-term viral replication in the eye. CONCLUSIONS: MDS can identify fungi, parasites, and DNA and RNA viruses in minute volumes of intraocular fluid samples. The identification of chronic intraocular rubella virus infection highlights the eye's role as a long-term pathogen reservoir, which has implications for virus eradication and emerging global epidemics.},

  abstract               = {Insensitivity and technical complexity have impeded the implementation of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing in differential diagnosis of viral infections in clinical laboratories. Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses ~2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100- to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics. IMPORTANCE : VirCapSeq-VERT enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.},

  abstract               = {We report a platform that increases the sensitivity of high-throughput sequencing for detection and characterization of bacteria, virulence determinants, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The system uses a probe set comprised of 4.2 million oligonucleotides based on the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) database, the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), and the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), representing 307 bacterial species that include all known human-pathogenic species, known antimicrobial resistance genes, and known virulence factors, respectively. The use of bacterial capture sequencing (BacCapSeq) resulted in an up to 1,000-fold increase in bacterial reads from blood samples and lowered the limit of detection by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to conventional unbiased high-throughput sequencing, down to a level comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR with as few as 5 million total reads generated per sample. It detected not only the presence of AMR genes but also biomarkers for AMR that included both constitutive and differentially expressed transcripts.IMPORTANCE BacCapSeq is a method for differential diagnosis of bacterial infections and defining antimicrobial sensitivity profiles that has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, health care costs, and the inappropriate use of antibiotics that contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance.},

DESIGN: The medical and microbiological records of patients with pulmonary fungal infection were retrospectively analyzed. SETTING: A university-affiliated tertiary medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1988 to December 1997, all cases of pulmonary fungal infection were reviewed. The criteria for inclusion were obvious lung lesion shown on chest radiographs and one of the following: (1) the presence of fungi in or isolation of fungi from the biopsy specimen of open thoracotomy, thoracoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy, or ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration/biopsy; or (2) isolation of fungi from pleural effusion or blood, with no evidence of extrapulmonary infection. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included. Ninety-four cases of pulmonary fungal infection (67%) were community acquired. The most frequently encountered fungi were Aspergillus species (57%), followed by Cryptococcus species (21%) and Candida species (14%). There were 72 patients with acute invasive fungal infection, with a mortality rate of 67%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that nosocomial infection (p = 0.014) and respiratory failure (p = 0.001) were significantly and independently associated with death of acute invasive fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary fungal infection of community-acquired origins is becoming a serious problem. It should be taken into consideration for differential diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, acute invasive fungal infection is associated with a much higher mortality rate for patients with nosocomial infection or complicating respiratory failure. Early diagnosis with prompt antifungal therapy, or even with surgical intervention, might be warranted to save patients' lives.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Though basigin (BSG) was reported to be overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and correlate with the development of NPC, the molecular basis of BSG in NPC remained elusive. The aim of the research was to investigate BSG expression in NPC and the potential molecular mechanism underlying it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BSG expression in NPC tissues was detected with immunohistochemistry. Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation test were performed to examine the relationship between BSG expression and the clinico-pathological features as well as EGFR and P-53 expression in NPC. In addition, data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and oncomine were collected to validate BSG expression in NPC. Meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between BSG expression and the clinico-pathological variables of NPC. The prognostic value and the alteration of BSG gene status were also analyzed with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: BSG presented notably higher expression in NPC tissues than in non-cancer tissues. Moreover, IHC results showed that BSG expression was significantly correlated with tumor progression. A positive correlation was also found between BSG expression and EGFR, P53 expression. Meta-analysis confirmed that BSG was indicative of lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in NPC. Additionally, data from cBioPortal indicated that alteration of BSG gene existed in 5% of NPC cases and BSG correlative genes were obtained from the Co-expression Analysis in TCGA. CONCLUSION: BSG was overexpressed in NPC and might have an oncogenic effect on the tumorigenesis and progression of NPC.},

  abstract               = {Apart from beta-catenin accumulation, loss of 3p21 is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in numerous malignancies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Herein, we characterized a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) CACNA2D3, a voltage-dependent subunit alpha 2 delta 3 of a calcium channel complex. Downregulation of CACNA2D3 was frequently detected in primary NPCs and NPC cell lines compared with their nontumorigenic counterparts. Attenuated CACNA2D3 expression may be associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic single-nucleotide polymorphism sites (rs589281, rs1449325 and rs6797113) and/or epigenetic silencing by methylation and histone deacetylation. Given the extensive effects of calcium in cancer, we then investigated the tumor suppressive role and underlying mechanism of CACNA2D3 in the development and progression of NPC. CACNA2D3 was stably transfected into NPC cell lines (C666 and SUNE1) at levels comparative with the normal nasopharynx, alongside siRNA-mediated silencing in an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line (NP69) to conduct in vivo and in vitro functional assays. Our findings show that CACNA2D3-mediated increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) can induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and activation of NLK (through the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway) to antagonize Wnt signaling-mediated anchorage-dependent and independent cell proliferation (via CCND1 and CMYC), invasion (via MMP7) and epithelial-to-mesynchemal transition (via SNAIL). As the expression pattern of calcium channels and their degree of functionality can change with the progression of cancer, CACNA2D3 may indeed be a promising biomarker for NPC. Our study also warrants further exploration in the potential therapeutic use of existing epigenetic targeting drugs (e.g., 5-azacytidine, SAHA) to reconstitute CACNA2D3-associated tumor suppression in NPC.},

  abstract               = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to infectious mononucleosis and several human cancers. EBV encodes a conserved protein kinase BGLF4 that plays a key role in the viral life cycle. To provide new insight into the host proteins regulated by BGLF4, we utilized stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics to compare site-specific phosphorylation in BGLF4-expressing Akata B cells. Our analysis revealed BGLF4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of 3,046 unique sites corresponding to 1,328 proteins. Frequency analysis of these phosphosites revealed a proline-rich motif signature downstream of BGLF4, indicating a broader substrate recognition for BGLF4 than its cellular ortholog cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Further, motif analysis of the hyperphosphorylated sites revealed enrichment in ATM, ATR and Aurora kinase substrates while functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to the DNA damage response (DDR), mitosis and cell cycle. Phosphorylation of proteins associated with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) indicated checkpoint activation, an event that inactivates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, APC/C. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BGLF4 binds to and directly phosphorylates the key cellular proteins PP1, MPS1 and CDC20 that lie upstream of SAC activation and APC/C inhibition. Consistent with APC/C inactivation, we found that BGLF4 stabilizes the expression of many known APC/C substrates. We also noted hyperphosphorylation of 22 proteins associated the nuclear pore complex, which may contribute to nuclear pore disassembly and SAC activation. A drug that inhibits mitotic checkpoint activation also suppressed the accumulation of extracellular EBV virus. Taken together, our data reveal that, in addition to the DDR, manipulation of mitotic kinase signaling and SAC activation are mechanisms associated with lytic EBV replication. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002411 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD002411).},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Host responses during sepsis are highly heterogeneous, which hampers the identification of patients at high risk of mortality and their selection for targeted therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify biologically relevant molecular endotypes in patients with sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study that included consecutive patients admitted for sepsis to two intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and July 20, 2012 (discovery and first validation cohorts) and patients admitted with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia to 29 ICUs in the UK (second validation cohort). We generated genome-wide blood gene expression profiles from admission samples and analysed them by unsupervised consensus clustering and machine learning. The primary objective of this study was to establish endotypes for patients with sepsis, and assess the association of these endotypes with clinical traits and survival outcomes. We also established candidate biomarkers for the endotypes to allow identification of patient endotypes in clinical practice. FINDINGS: The discovery cohort had 306 patients, the first validation cohort had 216, and the second validation cohort had 265 patients. Four molecular endotypes for sepsis, designated Mars1-4, were identified in the discovery cohort, and were associated with 28-day mortality (log-rank p=0.022). In the discovery cohort, the worst outcome was found for patients classified as having a Mars1 endotype, and at 28 days, 35 (39%) of 90 people with a Mars1 endotype had died (hazard ratio [HR] vs all other endotypes 1.86 [95% CI 1.21-2.86]; p=0.0045), compared with 23 (22%) of 105 people with a Mars2 endotype (HR 0.64 [0.40-1.04]; p=0.061), 16 (23%) of 71 people with a Mars3 endotype (HR 0.71 [0.41-1.22]; p=0.19), and 13 (33%) of 40 patients with a Mars4 endotype (HR 1.13 [0.63-2.04]; p=0.69). Analysis of the net reclassification improvement using a combined clinical and endotype model significantly improved risk prediction to 0.33 (0.09-0.58; p=0.008). A 140-gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with sepsis to the four endotypes in both the first and second validation cohorts. Only Mars1 was consistently significantly associated with 28-day mortality across the cohorts. To facilitate possible clinical use, a biomarker was derived for each endotype; BPGM and TAP2 reliably identified patients with a Mars1 endotype. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a method for the molecular classification of patients with sepsis to four different endotypes upon ICU admission. Detection of sepsis endotypes might assist in providing personalised patient management and in selection for trials. FUNDING: Center for Translational Molecular Medicine, Netherlands.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Effective targeted therapy for sepsis requires an understanding of the heterogeneity in the individual host response to infection. We investigated this heterogeneity by defining interindividual variation in the transcriptome of patients with sepsis and related this to outcome and genetic diversity. METHODS: We assayed peripheral blood leucocyte global gene expression for a prospective discovery cohort of 265 adult patients admitted to UK intensive care units with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia and evidence of organ dysfunction. We then validated our findings in a replication cohort consisting of a further 106 patients. We mapped genomic determinants of variation in gene transcription between patients as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). FINDINGS: We discovered that following admission to intensive care, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood leucocytes defines two distinct sepsis response signatures (SRS1 and SRS2). The presence of SRS1 (detected in 108 [41%] patients in discovery cohort) identifies individuals with an immunosuppressed phenotype that included features of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell exhaustion, and downregulation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II. SRS1 was associated with higher 14 day mortality than was SRS2 (discovery cohort hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5, p=0.005; validation cohort HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.0007). We found that a predictive set of seven genes enabled the classification of patients as SRS1 or SRS2. We identified cis-acting and trans-acting eQTL for key immune and metabolic response genes and sepsis response networks. Sepsis eQTL were enriched in endotoxin-induced epigenetic marks and modulated the individual host response to sepsis, including effects specific to SRS group. We identified regulatory genetic variants involving key mediators of gene networks implicated in the hypoxic response and the switch to glycolysis that occurs in sepsis, including HIF1alpha and mTOR, and mediators of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell activation, and viral defence. INTERPRETATION: Our integrated genomics approach advances understanding of heterogeneity in sepsis by defining subgroups of patients with different immune response states and prognoses, as well as revealing the role of underlying genetic variation. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and create opportunities for a precision medicine approach to enable targeted therapeutic intervention to improve sepsis outcomes.

  abstract           = {CONTEXT: Severe sepsis is typically characterized by initial cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation. Whether this hyperinflammatory phase is followed by immunosuppression is controversial. Animal studies suggest that multiple immune defects occur in sepsis, but data from humans remain conflicting. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of sepsis with changes in host innate and adaptive immunity and to examine potential mechanisms for putative immunosuppression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Rapid postmortem spleen and lung tissue harvest was performed at the bedsides of 40 patients who died in intensive care units (ICUs) of academic medical centers with active severe sepsis to characterize their immune status at the time of death (2009-2011). Control spleens (n = 29) were obtained from patients who were declared brain-dead or had emergent splenectomy due to trauma; control lungs (n = 20) were obtained from transplant donors or from lung cancer resections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytokine secretion assays and immunophenotyping of cell surface receptor-ligand expression profiles were performed to identify potential mechanisms of immune dysfunction. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the loss of immune effector cells. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients with sepsis and controls were 71.7 (SD, 15.9) and 52.7 (SD, 15.0) years, respectively. The median number of ICU days for patients with sepsis was 8 (range, 1-195 days), while control patients were in ICUs for 4 or fewer days. The median duration of sepsis was 4 days (range, 1-40 days). Compared with controls, anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes from sepsis patients had significant reductions in cytokine secretion at 5 hours: tumor necrosis factor, 5361 (95% CI, 3327-7485) pg/mL vs 418 (95% CI, 98-738) pg/mL; interferon gamma, 1374 (95% CI, 550-2197) pg/mL vs 37.5 (95% CI, -5 to 80) pg/mL; interleukin 6, 3691 (95% CI, 2313-5070) vs 365 (95% CI, 87-642) pg/mL; and interleukin 10, 633 (95% CI, -269 to 1534) vs 58 (95% CI, -39 to 156) pg/mL; (P < .001 for all). There were similar reductions in 5-hour lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion. Cytokine secretion in sepsis patients was generally less than 10% that in controls, independent of age, duration of sepsis, corticosteroid use, and nutritional status. Although differences existed between spleen and lung, flow cytometric analysis showed increased expression of selected inhibitory receptors and ligands and expansion of suppressor cell populations in both organs. Unique differences in cellular inhibitory molecule expression existed in immune cells isolated from lungs of sepsis patients vs cancer patients and vs transplant donors. Immunohistochemical staining showed extensive depletion of splenic CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR cells and expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on lung epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who die in the ICU following sepsis compared with patients who die of nonsepsis etiologies have biochemical, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical findings consistent with immunosuppression. Targeted immune-enhancing therapy may be a valid approach in selected patients with sepsis.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Most studies about septic shock report a crude mortality rate that neither distinguishes between early and late deaths nor addresses the direct causes of death. We herein aimed to determine the modalities of death in septic shock. METHODS: This was a 6-year (2008-2013) monocenter retrospective study. All consecutive patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. Early and late deaths were defined as occurring within or after 3 days following ICU admission, respectively. The main cause of death in the ICU was determined from medical files. A multinomial logistic regression analysis using the status alive as the reference category was performed to identify the prognostic factors associated with early and late deaths. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 66 +/- 15 years and a high proportion (67 %) of comorbidities. The in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.2 and 45 %, respectively. Deaths occurred early for 78 (32 %) and later on for 166 (68 %) patients in the ICU (n = 124) or in the hospital (n = 42). Early deaths were mainly attributable to intractable multiple organ failure related to the primary infection (82 %) and to mesenteric ischemia (6.4 %). In-ICU late deaths were directly related to end-of-life decisions in 29 % of patients and otherwise mostly related to ICU-acquired complications, including nosocomial infections (20.4 %) and mesenteric ischemia (16.6 %). Independent determinants of early death were age, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, no pathogen identification, and initial severity. Among 3-day survivors, independent risk factors for late death were age, cirrhosis, no pathogen identification, and previous corticosteroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of septic shock-related deaths. Identification of risk factors of early and late deaths may determine differential prognostic patterns.},

  abstract           = {Background: Systemic reactivations of herpesviruses may occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, even in those without prior immune deficiency. However, the clinical relevance of these events is uncertain. Methods: In this study we selected patients admitted with septic shock and treated for more than 4 days from a prospectively enrolled cohort of consecutive adults in the mixed ICUs of 2 tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We excluded patients who had received antiviral treatment in the week before ICU admission and those with known immunodeficiency. We studied viremia episodes with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) by weekly polymerase chain reaction in plasma. Results: Among 329 patients, we observed 399 viremia episodes in 223 (68%) patients. Viremia with CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV was detected in 60 (18%), 157 (48%), 80 (24%), 87 (26%), 13 (4%), and 2 (0.6%) patients, respectively; 112 (34%) patients had multiple concurrent viremia events. Crude mortality in the ICU was 36% in this latter group compared to 19% in remaining patients (P < .01). After adjustment for potential confounders, time-dependent bias, and competing risks, only concurrent CMV and EBV reactivations remained independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-7.13). Conclusions: Herpesvirus reactivations were documented in 68% of septic shock patients without prior immunodeficiency and frequently occurred simultaneously. Concurrent reactivations could be independently associated with mortality. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01905033.},

  abstract               = {A current controversy is whether patients with sepsis progress to an immunosuppressed state. We hypothesized that reactivation of latent viruses occurred with prolonged sepsis thereby providing evidence of clinically-relevant immunosuppression and potentially providing a means to serially-monitor patients' immune status. Secondly, if viral loads are markedly elevated, they may contribute to morbidity and mortality. This study determined if reactivation of herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and the anellovirus TTV occurred in sepsis and correlated with severity. Serial whole blood and plasma samples from 560 critically-ill septic, 161 critically-ill non-septic, and 164 healthy age-matched patients were analyzed by quantitative-polymerase-chain-reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr (EBV), herpes-simplex (HSV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and TTV. Polyomaviruses BK and JC were quantitated in urine. Detectable virus was analyzed with respect to secondary fungal and opportunistic bacterial infections, ICU duration, severity of illness, and survival. Patients with protracted sepsis had markedly increased frequency of detectable virus. Cumulative viral DNA detection rates in blood were: CMV (24.2%), EBV (53.2%), HSV (14.1%), HHV-6 (10.4%), and TTV (77.5%). 42.7% of septic patients had presence of two or more viruses. The 50% detection rate for herpesviruses was 5-8 days after sepsis onset. A small subgroup of septic patients had markedly elevated viral loads (>104-106 DNA copies/ml blood) for CMV, EBV, and HSV. Excluding TTV, DNAemia was uncommon in critically-ill non-septic patients and in age-matched healthy controls. Compared to septic patients without DNAemia, septic patients with viremia had increased fungal and opportunistic bacterial infections. Patients with detectable CMV in plasma had higher 90-day mortality compared to CMV-negative patients; p<0.05. Reactivation of latent viruses is common with prolonged sepsis, with frequencies similar to those occurring in transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy and consistent with development of an immunosuppressive state. Whether reactivated latent viruses contribute to morbidity and mortality in sepsis remains unknown.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: Herpes viruses can be reactivated among immunocompetent patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been the most studied. We hypothesized that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could also be reactivated in immunocompetent patients during their stay in ICU and that this would be associated with morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 90 patients with an ICU stay of >/= 5 days. CMV and HSV were considered when clinically suspected and DNA was researched in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). EBV DNA viral quantification was performed in the blood samples. RESULTS: EBV DNA was detected in blood of 61 patients (median length for positivity of 7.5 days). CMV DNA was detected in blood of 16 patients (median length for positivity of 13.5 days) and BAL of 6 patients. HSV1 DNA was detected in the BAL of 28 patients (median length for positivity of 7.5 days). Nineteen patients had no viral reactivation, 1 experienced only CMV, 32 had only EBV, 5 had only HSV, 6 had EBV and CMV, 14 had EBV and HSV, and 9 patients reactivated three viruses. Mortality was higher among patients with EBV reactivation (33/61 vs. 7/25, p = 0.02). Length of stay (21 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001) and length of mechanical ventilation (15 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001) were higher among patients with EBV reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that EBV DNA is detected in blood of diverse ICU patients with >/= 5 days of stay and that it is associated with morbidity and mortality. Larger dynamic prospective studies are needed to correlate viral reactivation with immune system evolution during ICU stay and to determine the role of polyviral reactivations.},

  abstract               = {INTRODUCTION: The host response to septic shock is dynamic and complex. A sepsis-induced immunosuppression phase has recently been acknowledged and linked to bad outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Moreover, a marked suppression of the immune response has also been partially described in patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe trauma or burns. It has been hypothesized that immune monitoring could enable identification of patients who might most benefit from novel, adjunctive immune-stimulating therapies. However, there is currently neither a clear definition for such injury-induced immunosuppression nor a stratification biomarker compatible with clinical constraints. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We set up a prospective, longitudinal single-centre clinical study to determine the incidence, severity and persistency of innate and adaptive immune alterations in ICU patients. We optimized a workflow to describe and follow the immunoinflammatory status of 550 patients (septic shock, severe trauma/burn and major surgery) during the first 2 months after their initial injury. On each time point, two immune functional tests will be performed to determine whole-blood TNF-alpha production in response to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation and the T lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohaemagglutinin. In addition, a complete immunophenotyping using flow cytometry including monocyte HLA-DR expression and lymphocyte subsets will be obtained. New markers (ie, levels of expression of host mRNA and viral reactivation) will be also evaluated. Reference intervals will be determined from a cohort of 150 age-matched healthy volunteers. This clinical study will provide, for the first time, data describing the immune status of severe ICU patients over time. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the institutional review board (no 69HCL15_0379) and the French National Security agency for drugs and health-related products. Results will be disseminated through presentations at scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov Registration number: NCT02638779.

  abstract           = {Importance: Latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is present in more than half the adult population, and a viral reactivation (ie, when the virus becomes measurable in body fluids such as blood) can occur in up to one-third of these individuals during episodes of critical illness. Objective: To determine whether antiviral therapy is safe and effective for preventing CMV reactivation in a general population of critically ill patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial recruited 124 CMV-seropositive patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours in the intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and January 31, 2014. The mean baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of all patients was 17.6. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive anti-CMV prophylaxis with valacyclovir hydrochloride (n = 34) or low-dose valganciclovir hydrochloride (n = 46) for up to 28 days to suppress viral reactivation, or to a control group with no intervention (n = 44). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to first CMV reactivation in blood within the 28-day follow-up period following initiation of the study drug. Results: Among the 124 patients in the study (46 women and 78 men; mean [SD] age, 56.9 [16.9] years), viral reactivation in the blood occurred in 12 patients in the control group, compared with 1 patient in the valganciclovir group and 2 patients in the valacyclovir group (combined treatment groups vs control: hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% CI 0.04-0.50). Although this trial was not powered to assess clinical end points, the valacyclovir arm was halted prematurely because of higher mortality; 14 of 34 patients (41.2%) had died by 28 days, compared with 5 of 37 (13.5%) patients in the control arm at the point of the decision to halt this arm. Other safety end points showed similar outcomes between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Antiviral prophylaxis with valacyclovir or low-dose valganciclovir suppresses CMV reactivation in patients with critical illness. However, given the higher mortality, a large-scale trial would be needed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CMV suppression.

To study the effect of BARF1 on EBV-induced transformation, we added recombinant BARF1 to B cells in the presence of EBV. BARF1 did not enhance transformation of B cells by EBV in vitro. To study the role of BARF1 in the context of EBV infection, we constructed a recombinant EBV mutant with a large deletion followed by stop codons in the BARF1 gene as well as a recombinant virus with a wild-type BARF1 gene. While BARF1 has previously been shown to act as an oncogene in several cell lines, the EBV BARF1 deletion mutant transformed B cells and initiated latent infection, and the B cells transformed with the BARF1 mutant virus induced tumors in SCID mice with an efficiency similar to that of the wild-type recombinant virus. Since human CSF-1 stimulates secretion of alpha interferon from mononuclear cells and BARF1 encodes a soluble CSF-1 receptor, we examined whether recombinant BARF1 or BARF1 derived from EBV-infected B cells could inhibit alpha interferon secretion. Recombinant BARF1 inhibited alpha interferon secretion by mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The B cells transformed with mutant BARF1 EBV showed reduced inhibition of alpha interferon secretion by human mononuclear cells when compared with the B cells transformed with wild-type recombinant virus. These experiments indicate that BARF1 expressed from the EBV genome directly inhibits alpha interferon secretion, which may modulate the innate host response to the virus.},

The cytokine IFN-gamma plays a central role in resistance of the host to infection via direct antiviral effects as well as modulation of the immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early protein, BZLF1, inhibits the IFN-gamma signaling pathway. BZLF1 decreases the ability of IFN-gamma to activate a variety of important downstream target genes, such as IRF-1, p48, and CIITA, and prevents IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC surface expression. Additionally, BZLF1 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.

  abstract           = {Interleukin-10 (IL-10), first recognized for its ability to inhibit activation and effector function of T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, is a multifunctional cytokine with diverse effects on most hemopoietic cell types. The principal routine function of IL-10 appears to be to limit and ultimately terminate inflammatory responses. In addition to these activities, IL-10 regulates growth and/or differentiation of B cells, NK cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. IL-10 plays a key role in differentiation and function of a newly appreciated type of T cell, the T regulatory cell, which may figure prominently in control of immune responses and tolerance in vivo. Uniquely among hemopoietic cytokines, IL-10 has closely related homologs in several virus genomes, which testify to its crucial role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. This review highlights findings that have advanced our understanding of IL-10 and its receptor, as well as its in vivo function in health and disease.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need for more objective methods of identifying patients at risk for septic shock and poorer outcomes among those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As viral load is useful in viral infections, we hypothesized that bacterial load may be associated with outcomes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: Quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA level by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) was prospectively conducted on whole-blood samples from a cohort of 353 patients who were displaying CAP symptoms upon their admission to the ED. RESULTS: CAP caused by S pneumoniae was documented in 93 patients (36.5% with positive blood culture findings). A positive S pneumoniae rt-PCR assay finding was associated with a statistically significant higher mortality (odds ratio [OR], 7.08), risk for shock (OR, 6.29), and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) [OR, 7.96]. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and pneumonia severity index class, revealed bacterial load as independently associated with septic shock (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.42; 95% CI, 1.10 to 5.80) and the need for MV (aOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.17 to 6.27). An S pneumoniae bacterial load of >or= 10(3) copies per milliliter occurred in 29.0% of patients (27 of 93 patients; 95% CI, 20.8 to 38.9%) being associated with a statistically significant higher risk for septic shock (OR, 8.00), the need for MV (OR, 10.50), and hospital mortality (OR, 5.43). CONCLUSION: In patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, bacterial load is associated with the likelihood of death, the risk of septic shock, and the need for MV. High genomic bacterial load for S pneumoniae may be a useful tool for severity assessment.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of high throughput biotechnology data acquisition platforms such as micro arrays, SNP chips and mass spectrometers, data sets with many more variables than observations are now routinely being collected. Finding relationships between response variables of interest and variables in such data sets is an important problem akin to finding needles in a haystack. Whilst methods for a number of response types have been developed a general approach has been lacking. RESULTS: The major contribution of this paper is to present a unified methodology which allows many common (statistical) response models to be fitted to such data sets. The class of models includes virtually any model with a linear predictor in it, for example (but not limited to), multiclass logistic regression (classification), generalised linear models (regression) and survival models. A fast algorithm for finding sparse well fitting models is presented. The ideas are illustrated on real data sets with numbers of variables ranging from thousands to millions. R code implementing the ideas is available for download. CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper enables existing work on response models when there are less variables than observations to be leveraged to the situation when there are many more variables than observations. It is a powerful approach to finding parsimonious models for such datasets. The method is capable of handling problems with millions of variables and a large variety of response types within the one framework. The method compares favourably to existing methods such as support vector machines and random forests, but has the advantage of not requiring separate variable selection steps. It is also works for data types which these methods were not designed to handle. The method usually produces very sparse models which make biological interpretation simpler and more focused.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Biological interpretation of genomic summary data such as those resulting from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies is one of the major bottlenecks in medical genomics research, calling for efficient and integrative tools to resolve this problem. RESULTS: We introduce eXploring Genomic Relations (XGR), an open source tool designed for enhanced interpretation of genomic summary data enabling downstream knowledge discovery. Targeting users of varying computational skills, XGR utilises prior biological knowledge and relationships in a highly integrated but easily accessible way to make user-input genomic summary datasets more interpretable. We show how by incorporating ontology, annotation, and systems biology network-driven approaches, XGR generates more informative results than conventional analyses. We apply XGR to GWAS and eQTL summary data to explore the genomic landscape of the activated innate immune response and common immunological diseases. We provide genomic evidence for a disease taxonomy supporting the concept of a disease spectrum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory disorders. We also show how XGR can define SNP-modulated gene networks and pathways that are shared and distinct between diseases, how it achieves functional, phenotypic and epigenomic annotations of genes and variants, and how it enables exploring annotation-based relationships between genetic variants. CONCLUSIONS: XGR provides a single integrated solution to enhance interpretation of genomic summary data for downstream biological discovery. XGR is released as both an R package and a web-app, freely available at http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/XGR .},

The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models.

  abstract           = {IMPORTANCE: Because clinical features do not reliably distinguish bacterial from viral infection, many children worldwide receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment, while bacterial infection is missed in others. OBJECTIVE: To identify a blood RNA expression signature that distinguishes bacterial from viral infection in febrile children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Febrile children presenting to participating hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States between 2009-2013 were prospectively recruited, comprising a discovery group and validation group. Each group was classified after microbiological investigation as having definite bacterial infection, definite viral infection, or indeterminate infection. RNA expression signatures distinguishing definite bacterial from viral infection were identified in the discovery group and diagnostic performance assessed in the validation group. Additional validation was undertaken in separate studies of children with meningococcal disease (n = 24) and inflammatory diseases (n = 48) and on published gene expression datasets. EXPOSURES: A 2-transcript RNA expression signature distinguishing bacterial infection from viral infection was evaluated against clinical and microbiological diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Definite bacterial and viral infection was confirmed by culture or molecular detection of the pathogens. Performance of the RNA signature was evaluated in the definite bacterial and viral group and in the indeterminate infection group. RESULTS: The discovery group of 240 children (median age, 19 months; 62% male) included 52 with definite bacterial infection, of whom 36 (69%) required intensive care, and 92 with definite viral infection, of whom 32 (35%) required intensive care. Ninety-six children had indeterminate infection. Analysis of RNA expression data identified a 38-transcript signature distinguishing bacterial from viral infection. A smaller (2-transcript) signature (FAM89A and IFI44L) was identified by removing highly correlated transcripts. When this 2-transcript signature was implemented as a disease risk score in the validation group (130 children, with 23 definite bacterial, 28 definite viral, and 79 indeterminate infections; median age, 17 months; 57% male), all 23 patients with microbiologically confirmed definite bacterial infection were classified as bacterial (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI, 100%-100%]) and 27 of 28 patients with definite viral infection were classified as viral (specificity, 96.4% [95% CI, 89.3%-100%]). When applied to additional validation datasets from patients with meningococcal and inflammatory diseases, bacterial infection was identified with a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI, 79.2%-100%) and 90.0% (95% CI, 70.0%-100%), respectively, and with specificity of 96.0% (95% CI, 88.0%-100%) and 95.8% (95% CI, 89.6%-100%). Of the children in the indeterminate groups, 46.3% (63/136) were classified as having bacterial infection, although 94.9% (129/136) received antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides preliminary data regarding test accuracy of a 2-transcript host RNA signature discriminating bacterial from viral infection in febrile children. Further studies are needed in diverse groups of patients to assess accuracy and clinical utility of this test in different clinical settings.},

  abstract               = {Host response biomarkers can accurately distinguish between influenza and bacterial infection. However, published biomarkers require the measurement of many genes, thereby making it difficult to implement them in clinical practice. This study aims to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high diagnostic accuracy equivalent to multi-gene biomarkers.In this study, we combined an integrated genomic analysis of 1071 individuals with in vitro experiments using well-established infection models.We identified a single-gene biomarker, IFI27, which had a high prediction accuracy (91%) equivalent to that obtained by multi-gene biomarkers. In vitro studies showed that IFI27 was upregulated by TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells that responded to influenza virus rather than bacteria. In vivo studies confirmed that IFI27 was expressed in influenza patients but not in bacterial infection, as demonstrated in multiple patient cohorts (n=521). In a large prospective study (n=439) of patients presented with undifferentiated respiratory illness (aetiologies included viral, bacterial and non-infectious conditions), IFI27 displayed 88% diagnostic accuracy (AUC) and 90% specificity in discriminating between influenza and bacterial infections.IFI27 represents a significant step forward in overcoming a translational barrier in applying genomic assay in clinical setting; its implementation may improve the diagnosis and management of respiratory infection.},

  abstract           = {To complete their life cycle and spread, viruses interfere with and gain control of diverse cellular processes, this most often occurring through interaction between viral proteins (VPs) and resident protein partners. Among the latter, Src family kinases (SFKs), a class of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that contributes to the conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular signaling cascades and is involved in virtually all cellular processes, have recently emerged as critical mediators between the cell's infrastructure and the viral demands. In this scenario, structural or ex novo synthesized VPs are able to bind to the different domains of these enzymes through specific short linear motifs present along their sequences. Proline-rich motifs displaying the conserved minimal consensus PxxP and recognizing the SFK Src homology (SH)3 domain constitute a cardinal signature for the formation of multiprotein complexes and this interaction may promote phosphorylation of VPs by SFKs, thus creating phosphotyrosine motifs that become a docking site for the SH2 domains of SFKs or other SH2 domain-bearing signaling molecules. Importantly, the formation of these assemblies also results in a change in the activity and/or location of SFKs, and these events are critical in perturbing key signaling pathways so that viruses can utilize the cell's machinery to their own benefit. In the light of these observations, although VPs as such, especially those with enzyme activity, are still regarded as valuable targets for therapeutic strategies, multiprotein complexes composed of viral and host cell proteins are increasingly becoming objects of investigation with a view to deeply characterize the structural aspects that favor their formation and to develop new compounds able to contrast viral diseases in an alternative manner.},

Of key interest are a group of genes encoding the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which have known and hypothesized roles in autoimmune diseases, resistance to viruses, reproductive conditions, and cancer. These genes are highly polymorphic, which makes typing expensive and time consuming. Consequently, despite their importance, KIRs have been little studied in large cohorts. Statistical imputation methods developed for other complex loci (e.g., human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) on the basis of SNP data provide an inexpensive high-throughput alternative to direct laboratory typing of these loci and have enabled important findings and insights for many diseases. We present KIR *IMP, a method for imputation of KIR copy number. We show that KIR *IMP is highly accurate and thus allows the study of KIRs in large cohorts and enables detailed investigation of the role of KIRs in human disease.},

We aimed to determine the correlations between these alleles and natural outcomes of HCV and determine associated key T-cell responses. METHODS: In a cohort of HCV individuals, we determined HLA class I alleles, HCV outcomes, T-cell responses, and examined sequence data for mutational changes within key epitopes. RESULTS: Carriage of HLA-B 57 was associated with a higher rate of viral clearance (risk ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-3.4), while HLA-B 08 was associated with a lower rate (risk ratio = 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9]. Two HLA-B 57-restricted T-cell epitopes were targeted in spontaneous clearance; subjects with chronic viremia expressing HLA-B 57 harbored HCV strains with a high frequency of mutations in key residues. HLA-B 57-mediated escape was supported by diminished immune recognition of these variants and acute HCV infection revealing viral evolution toward less recognized variants. Analysis of a genotype 1b strain from a single-source HCV outbreak in which HLA-B 57 was not protective revealed sequence variations that interfere with immunogenicity, thereby preventing HLA-B 57-mediated immune pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a role of HLA-B 57-restricted CD8(+) T-cell responses in mediating spontaneous clearance and evolution in HCV infection, and viral strains containing epitope variants that are less recognized abrogate the protective effects of HLA-B 57. The finding that HLA-B 57-mediated antiviral immunity is associated with control of both human immunodeficiency virus-1 and HCV suggests a common shared mechanism of a successful immune response against persistent viruses.},

  abstract           = {Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses play an important role in the natural course of infection; however, the impact of certain CD8+ T cell responses in determining clinical outcome has not been fully defined. A well-defined cohort of women inoculated with HCV from a single source showed that HLA-B27 has a strong association with spontaneous clearance. The immunological basis for this association is unknown. However, the finding is especially significant because HLA-B27 has also been shown to have a protective role in HIV infection. We report the identification of an HLA-B27 restricted hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T cell epitope that is recognized in the majority of recovered HLA-B27 positive women. In chronically HCV-infected individuals, analysis of the corresponding viral sequence showed a strong association between sequence variations within this epitope and expression of HLA-B27, indicating allele-specific selection pressure at the population level. Functional analysis in 3 chronically HCV-infected patients showed that the emerging variant viral epitopes represent escape mutations. In conclusion, our results suggest a dominant role of HLA-B27 in mediating spontaneous viral clearance as well as viral evolution in HCV infection and mechanistically link both associations to a dominant novel CD8+ T cell epitope. These results support the central role of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and the genetically determined restriction of the virus-specific T cell repertoire in HCV infection.},

Maximum HLA heterozygosity of class I loci (A, B, and C) delayed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) onset among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), whereas individuals who were homozygous for one or more loci progressed rapidly to AIDS and death. The HLA class I alleles B*35 and Cw*04 were consistently associated with rapid development of AIDS-defining conditions in Caucasians. The extended survival of 28 to 40 percent of HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients who avoided AIDS for ten or more years can be attributed to their being fully heterozygous at HLA class I loci, to their lacking the AIDS-associated alleles B*35 and Cw*04, or to both.},

  abstract           = {Following their discovery in the early 1970s, classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been the prototypical candidates for genetic susceptibility to infectious disease. Indeed, the original hypothesis for the extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious diseases in the future.},

To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified >300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: The narrow host range of Mycobacterium leprae and the fact that it is refractory to growth in culture has limited research on and the biologic understanding of leprosy. Host genetic factors are thought to influence susceptibility to infection as well as disease progression. METHODS: We performed a two-stage genomewide association study by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using the Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina). We then tested three independent replication sets for an association between the presence of leprosy and 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were most strongly associated with the disease in the genomewide association study. Together, these replication sets comprised 3254 patients and 5955 controls. We also carried out tests of heterogeneity of the associations (or lack thereof) between these 93 SNPs and disease, stratified according to clinical subtype (multibacillary vs. paucibacillary). RESULTS: We observed a significant association (P<1.00x10(-10)) between SNPs in the genes CCDC122, C13orf31, NOD2, TNFSF15, HLA-DR, and RIPK2 and a trend toward an association (P=5.10x10(-5)) with a SNP in LRRK2. The associations between the SNPs in C13orf31, LRRK2, NOD2, and RIPK2 and multibacillary leprosy were stronger than the associations between these SNPs and paucibacillary leprosy. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of genes in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (which regulates the innate immune response) are associated with susceptibility to infection with M. leprae.},

Together with data of an additional 1,481 Japanese healthy controls, association tests of six HLA loci including HLA-A, C, B, DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1, were performed. Although the strongest association was detected at a SNP located in the HLA-DP locus in a SNP-based GWAS using data from the 1,975 Japanese individuals, HLA genotyping-based analysis identified DQB1*06:01 as having the strongest association, showing a greater association with CHB susceptibility (OR = 1.76, P = 6.57 x 10(-18)) than any one of five HLA-DPB1 alleles that were previously reported as CHB susceptibility alleles. Moreover, HLA haplotype analysis showed that, among the five previously reported HLA-DPB1 susceptibility and protective alleles, the association of two DPB1 alleles (DPB1*09:01, and *04:01) had come from linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR-DQ haplotypes, DRB1*15:02-DQB1*06:01 and DRB1*13:02-DQB1*06:04, respectively. The present study showed an example that SNP-based GWAS does not necessarily detect the primary susceptibility locus in the HLA region.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether the host response of gram-positive sepsis differs from gram-negative sepsis at a transcriptome level. Using microarray technology, we compared the gene-expression profiles of gram-positive sepsis and gram-negative sepsis in critically ill patients. DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A 20-bed general intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-two patients admitted to the intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous blood was collected for leukocyte separation and RNA extraction. Microarray experiments were then performed examining the expression level of 18,664 genes in each sample. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no difference in the expression profile between gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis. The finding remained unchanged even when genes with lower expression level were included or after statistical stringency was lowered. There were, however, 94 genes differentially expressed between sepsis and control patients. These genes included those involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed that the difference in gene expression profile existed between sepsis and control patients but not between gram-positive and gram-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive sepsis and gram-negative sepsis share a common host response at a transcriptome level. These findings support the hypothesis that the septic response is nonspecific and is designed to provide a more general response that can be elicited by a wide range of different microorganisms.},

There are scarce data available on classical HLA class I association with the influenza A H1N1/09 pandemic. Methods: We analyzed the frequency of classical HLA class I alleles and haplotypes in A H1N1/09 influenza in a case-control study including 138 influenza patients (INF-P) and 225 asymptomatic healthy contacts (INF-C) simultaneously recruited. HLA class I typing was performed by high-resolution sequence-based typing method. Results: Our analysis revealed higher frequency of C *07:02:01, B *39:06:02, C *03:02:01, B *44:03:01, B *51:01:05, and B *73:01 (p < 0.05; OR = 1.84-9.98) and of two haplotypes-A *68:01:02-C *07:02:01 (p = 1.05E - 05; OR = 23.99) and B *35:01:01-C *07:02.01 (p = 4.15E - 04, OR = 2.15)-in A H1N1/09 influenza subjects. A *68:01:01 was exclusively present only in the INF-P group (5/138). A decrease in the frequency of C *03:03:01, A *11:01:01, B *39:01:01, A *24:02:01, C *03:04:01, B *51:01:01, and C *07:01:01 (p < 0.05; OR = 0.12-0.52) and of haplotypes A *02:01:01-B *35:01:01-C *04:01:01, A *24:02:01-B *35:01:01, B *39:01:01-C *07:02:01, and B *40:02:01-C *03:04:01 (p < 0.05; OR = 0.08-0.22) were observed in INF-P group. Conclusion: Selective classical HLA class I allele and haplotype combinations predispose individuals towards susceptibility or protection against the influenza A H1N1/09 pandemic. This work has significant implications for accessing population transmission risk for A H1N1/09 or a similar strain breakout in the future.},

  abstract           = {To study whether individual HLA class I alleles are used preferentially or equally in human virus-specific CTL responses, the contribution of individual HLA-A and -B alleles to the human influenza virus-specific CTL response was investigated. To this end, PBMC were obtained from three groups of HLA-A and -B identical blood donors and stimulated with influenza virus. In the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell population, the proportion of IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-producing cells, restricted by individual HLA-A and -B alleles, was determined using virus-infected C1R cells expressing a single HLA-A or -B allele for restimulation of these cells. In HLA-B*2705- and HLA-B*3501-positive individuals, these alleles were preferentially used in the influenza A virus-specific CTL response, while the contribution of HLA-B*0801 and HLA-A*0101 was minor in these donors. The magnitude of the HLA-B*0801-restricted response was even lower in the presence of HLA-B*2705. C1R cells expressing HLA-B*2705, HLA-A*0101, or HLA-A*0201 were preferentially lysed by virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, the CTL response to influenza B virus was mainly directed toward HLA-B*0801-restricted epitopes. Thus, the preferential use of HLA alleles depended on the virus studied.},

  abstract               = {It was hypothesized that the EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell response may be dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, possibly leading to a suboptimal control of this virus. To examine the CD8(+) T cell response in greater detail, we analyzed the HLA-A2-, HLA-B7-, and HLA-B8-restricted EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in a high number of MS patients and control subjects using tetramers. Content in cytolytic granules, as well as cytotoxic activity, of EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells was assessed. We found that MS patients had a lower or a higher prevalence of HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, respectively. Using HLA class I tetramers in HLA-B7(+) MS patients, there was a higher prevalence of MS patients with HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific CD8(+) T cells ex vivo. However, the magnitude of the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific and HLA-B*0702/CMV(TPR)-specific CD8(+) T cell response (i.e., the percentage of tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in a study subject harboring CD8(+) T cells specific for the given epitope) was lower in MS patients. No differences were found using other tetramers. After stimulation with the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP) peptide, the production of IL-2, perforin, and granzyme B and the cytotoxicity of HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific CD8(+) T cells were decreased. Altogether, our findings suggest that the HLA-B*0702-restricted viral (in particular the EBV one)-specific CD8(+) T cell response is dysregulated in MS patients. This observation is particularly interesting knowing that the HLA-B7 allele is more frequently expressed in MS patients and considering that EBV is associated with MS.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: The etiopathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to include genetic and environmental factors. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, in particular, are associated with disease susceptibility, whereas Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection has long been suspected to play a role in disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate correlations between HLA alleles and EBV infection in MS. METHODS: HLA alleles, EBV viral load (VL) and serum anti-EBV antibody titers were evaluated in EBV-seropositive MS patients (N = 117) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; N = 89). RESULTS: Significantly higher DNA viral loads (p = 0.048) and EBNA-1 antibody titer (p = 0.0004) were seen in MS compared to HC. EBV VL was higher in HLA-B*07+ (p = 0.02) and HLA-DRB1*15+ (p = 0.02) MS patients, whereas it was lower in HLA-A*02+ (p = 0.04) subjects. EBV VL was highest in HLA-A*02-/B*07+/DRB1*15+ patients and lowest in HLA-A*A02+/B*07-/DRB1*15- individuals (p < 0.0001). HLA-B*07 resulted the most associated allele to EBV VL after multiple regression analysis considering altogether the three alleles, (p = 0.0001). No differences were observed in anti-EBV antibody titers in relationship with HLA distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Host HLA-B*07 allele influence EBV VL in MS. As HLA-class I molecules present antigens to T lymphocytes and initiate immune response against viruses, these results could support a role for EBV in MS.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among U.S. adults. Incidence estimates of pneumonia confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic tests are needed. METHODS: We conducted active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults 18 years of age or older in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville. Patients with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression were excluded. Blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for culture, serologic testing, antigen detection, and molecular diagnostic testing. Study radiologists independently reviewed chest radiographs. We calculated population-based incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization according to age and pathogen. RESULTS: From January 2010 through June 2012, we enrolled 2488 of 3634 eligible adults (68%). Among 2320 adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia (93%), the median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 46 to 71); 498 patients (21%) required intensive care, and 52 (2%) died. Among 2259 patients who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens available for both bacterial and viral testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%): one or more viruses in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacterial and viral pathogens in 59 (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%). The annual incidence of pneumonia was 24.8 cases (95% confidence interval, 23.5 to 26.1) per 10,000 adults, with the highest rates among adults 65 to 79 years of age (63.0 cases per 10,000 adults) and those 80 years of age or older (164.3 cases per 10,000 adults). For each pathogen, the incidence increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was highest among the oldest adults. Despite current diagnostic tests, no pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria.

  abstract           = {IMPORTANCE: Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock. PROCESS: A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment). KEY FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant. RECOMMENDATIONS: Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.},

Its manipulation can cause both benefit and harm. More than 100 randomized clinical trials have tested the hypothesis that modulating the septic response to infection can improve survival. With one short-lived exception, none of these has resulted in new treatments. The current challenge for sepsis research lies in a failure of concept and reluctance to abandon a demonstrably ineffectual research model. Future success will necessitate large studies of clinical and biochemical epidemiology to understand the course of illness, better integration of basic and clinical science, and the creation of stratification systems to target treatment towards those who are most likely to benefit.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: In patients with sepsis the production of arachidonic acid metabolites by cyclooxygenase increases, but the pathophysiologic role of these prostaglandins is unclear. In animal models, inhibition of cyclooxygenase by treatment with ibuprofen before the onset of sepsis reduces physiologic abnormalities and improves survival. In pilot studies of patients with sepsis, treatment with ibuprofen led to improvements in gas exchange and airway mechanics. METHODS: From October 1989 to March 1995, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ibuprofen (10 mg per kilogram of body weight [maximal dose, 800 mg], given every six hours for eight doses) in 455 patients who had sepsis, defined as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and acute failure of at least one organ system. RESULTS: In the ibuprofen group, but not the placebo group, there were significant declines in urinary levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane, temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis. With ibuprofen therapy there was no increased incidence of renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other adverse events. However, treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the incidence or duration of shock or the acute respiratory distress syndrome and did not significantly improve the rate of survival at 30 days (mortality, 37 percent with ibuprofen vs 40 percent with placebo). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, treatment with ibuprofen reduces levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane and decreases fever, tachycardia, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis, but it does not prevent the development of shock or the acute respiratory distress syndrome and does not improve survival.},

DESIGN: Large, simple, group-sequential, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 603 investigators at 513 community and university-affiliated hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Within 6 hours before enrollment, the patients had been in shock with a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg after adequate fluid challenge or had received vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. These episodes of shock began within 24 hours of enrollment. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of gram-negative infection as the cause of the shock episode and a commitment from the patients' physicians to provide full supportive care were required. MEASUREMENTS: Blood cultures were obtained within 48 hours of enrollment, and death at day 14 after treatment was recorded. Adverse events occurring within 14 days after enrollment were also tabulated. RESULTS: 2199 patients were enrolled; 621 (28.2%) met all enrollment criteria, received HA-1A or placebo, and had confirmed gram-negative bacteremia. Mortality rates in this group were as follows: placebo, 32% (95 and HA-1A, 33% (109 of 328) (P = 0.864, Fisher exact test, two-tailed; 95% CI for the difference, -6.2% to 8.6%). Mortality rates in the patients without gram-negative bacteremia were as follows: placebo, 37% (292 of 793) and HA-1A, 41% (318 of 785) (P = 0.073, Fisher exact test, one-tailed; CI, -0.8% to 8.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, HA-1A was not effective in reducing the 14-day mortality rate in patients with gram-negative bacteremia and septic shock. These data do not support using septic shock as an indication for HA-1A treatment. If HA-1A is effective in reducing the mortality rate in patients dying from endotoxemia, these patients must be identified using other treatment criteria.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of BAY x 1351, a murine monoclonal antibody to recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, in patients with sepsis. DESIGN: An international, multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled trial in patients with sepsis, stratified into shock/nonshock groups. SETTING: Forty acute clinical care facilities in 14 countries. PATIENTS: Of the 564 patients enrolled in the study, 553 patients received study drug or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 15 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg of BAY x 1351, or placebo, as a single intravenous infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were well matched for severity of illness and for risk factors known to influence the outcome of sepsis. There was no difference in 28-day mortality rates between groups (placebo group 66 [39.5%] of 167;3 mg/kg group 57 [31.5%] of 181; 15 mg/kg group 87 [42.4%] of 205). Approximately 9 months after this study had begun, an interim safety examination of NORASEPT, a North American Sepsis Trial using the same monoclonal antibody, indicated that there was no benefit to patients in the nonshock group and further enrollment of these nonshock septic patients into INTERSEPT was stopped. The analysis therefore focused on the 420 patients in shock. The primary efficacy variable was the 28-day, all-cause mortality rate: placebo group 57 (42.9%) of 133; 3-mg/kg group 51 (36.7%) of 139; and 15-mg/kg group 66 (44.6%) of 148 (not significant). Two secondary efficacy variables were identified prospectively: shock reversal and frequency of organ failures. Life-table analysis showed that in patients who survived 28 days, there was a more rapid reversal of shock in both treatment groups compared with placebo (15-mg/kg group vs. placebo group log-rank statistic p = .007, 3-mg/kg group vs. placebo group p = .01). Similarly, in patients surviving 28 days, there was a significant delay in the time to the onset of first organ failure (log rank 15 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .03, 3 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .07), and more patients in the placebo group developed at least one organ failure: 15-mg/kg group 33 (40.2%) of 82; 3-mg/kg group 39 (44.3%) of 88; and placebo group 45 (59.2%) of 76 (15 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .03, 3 mg/kg vs. placebo p = .06). No significant adverse events were associated with the monoclonal antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: INTERSEPT provides additional clinical data implicating TNF-alpha as an integral mediator of septic shock. The study suggested a possible role for anti-TNF antibody as adjunctive therapy, but this possibility requires confirmation by another clinical trial.},

In this phase III multicenter trial, we assessed whether intravenous immunoglobulin G (ivIgG) reduced 28-day mortality and improved morbidity in patients with score-defined severe sepsis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-three medical and surgical intensive care units in university centers and large teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients (n = 653) with score-defined sepsis (sepsis score 12-27) and score-defined sepsis-induced severity of disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 20-35). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive either placebo or ivIgG (day 0, 0.6 g/kg body weight; day 1, 0.3 g/kg body weight). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause after 28 days. Prospectively defined secondary end points were 7-day all-cause mortality, short-term change in morbidity, and pulmonary function at day 4. Six hundred fifty-three patients from 23 active centers formed the intention-to-treat group, 624 patients the per-protocol group (placebo group, n = 303; ivIgG group, n = 321). The 28-day mortality rate was 37.3% in the placebo group and 39.3% in the ivIgG group and thus not significantly different (p = .6695). Seven-day mortality was not reduced, and 4-day pulmonary function was not improved. Drug-related adverse events were rare in both groups. Exploratory findings revealed a 3-day shortening of mechanical ventilation in the surviving patients and no effect of ivIgG on plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with score-defined severe sepsis, ivIgG with a total dose of 0.9 g/kg body weight does not reduce mortality.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common and frequently fatal condition. Human recombinant activated protein C (APC) has been used to reduce the high rate of death by severe sepsis or septic shock. This is an update of a Cochrane review (originally published in 2007 and updated in 2008). OBJECTIVES: We assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of APC for the treatment of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. SEARCH METHODS: For this updated review we searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2010); EMBASE (1980 to July 1, 2010); BIOSIS (1965 to July 1, 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 16 June 2010) and LILACS (1982 to 16 June 2010). There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of APC for severe sepsis in adults and children. We excluded studies on neonates. We considered all-cause mortality at day 28, at the end of study follow up, and hospital mortality as the primary outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We estimated relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one new RCT in this update. We included a total of five RCTs involving 5101 participants. For 28-day mortality, APC did not reduce the risk of death in adult participants with severe sepsis (pooled RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.22; P = 0.82, I(2) = 68%). APC use was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.00; P = 0.01, I(2) = 0%). In paediatric patients, APC did not reduce the risk of death (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.46; P = 0.93). Although the included trials had no major limitations most of them modified their original completion or recruitment protocols. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This updated review found no evidence suggesting that APC should be used for treating patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Additionally, APC is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Unless additional RCTs provide evidence of a treatment effect, policy-makers, clinicians and academics should not promote the use of APC.Warning: On October 25th 2011, the European Medicines Agency issued a press release on the worldwide withdrawal of Xigris (activated protein C / drotrecogin alfa) from the market by Eli Lilly due to lack of beneficial effect on 28-day mortality in the PROWESS-SHOCK study. Furthermore, Eli Lily has announced the discontinuation of all other ongoing clinical trials. The final results of the PROWESS-SHOCK study are expected to be published in 2012. This systematic review will be updated when results of the PROWESS-SHOCK or other trials are published.},

DESIGN: This study was multicenter, double-blind, and randomized. SETTING: Intensive care units PATIENTS Adult patients with bacterial pneumonia, either acquired or nosocomial, as confirmed by chest radiograph and positive culture or Gram-negative stain, and severe sepsis, defined as sepsis-induced hypotension or organ dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: Standard antibiotic therapy with or without filgrastim (300 microg/day) or placebo administered as a 30-min intravenous infusion. The study drug was started within 24 hrs of enrollment and was continued for 5 days or until the white blood cell count reached >75.0 x 10(9) cells/L. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point was the occurrence of mortality through day 29; secondary end points included occurrence of subsequent organ dysfunction, time to discharge from intensive care unit, number of days on mechanical ventilatory support, and time to death. Study-related observations were recorded through day 10 and included vital signs, onset of organ dysfunction, clinical laboratory variables, and adverse events. Filgrastim increased the white blood cell count to a median peak of 31.7 x 10(9) cells/L from a baseline of 12.3 x 10(9) cells/L. The two groups were well matched and did not differ significantly with regard to severe adverse events, time to death, occurrence of end-organ dysfunction, days of intensive care unit hospitalization, or days on mechanical ventilatory support. Mortality was low in both treatment groups; the mortality rate in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of filgrastim to the antibiotic and supportive care treatment of patients with pneumonia complicated by severe sepsis appeared to be safe, but not efficacious in reducing mortality rates or complications from this infection.},

  abstract           = {RATIONALE: There remains uncertainty about the role of corticosteroids in sepsis with clear beneficial effects on shock duration, but conflicting survival effects. Two transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRSs) have been identified. SRS1 is relatively immunosuppressed, whereas SRS2 is relatively immunocompetent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to categorize patients based on SRS endotypes to determine if these profiles influenced response to either norepinephrine or vasopressin, or to corticosteroids in septic shock. METHODS: A post hoc analysis was performed of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in septic shock (VANISH [Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine as Initial Therapy in Septic Shock]). Patients were included within 6 hours of onset of shock and were randomized to receive norepinephrine or vasopressin followed by hydrocortisone or placebo. Genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed and SRS endotype was determined by a previously established model using seven discriminant genes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Samples were available from 176 patients: 83 SRS1 and 93 SRS2. There was no significant interaction between SRS group and vasopressor assignment (P = 0.50). However, there was an interaction between assignment to hydrocortisone or placebo, and SRS endotype (P = 0.02). Hydrocortisone use was associated with increased mortality in those with an SRS2 phenotype (odds ratio = 7.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.6-39.9). CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic profile at onset of septic shock was associated with response to corticosteroids. Those with the immunocompetent SRS2 endotype had significantly higher mortality when given corticosteroids compared with placebo. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (ISRCTN 20769191).},

  abstract               = {RATIONALE: Studies of long-term functional outcomes of elderly survivors of mechanical ventilation (MV) are limited to local samples and biased retrospective, proxy-reported preadmission functional status. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact on disability of hospitalization with MV, compared with hospitalization without MV, accounting for prospectively assessed prior functional status. METHODS: Retrospective population-based longitudinal cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older enrolled in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, 1996-2003. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Premeasures and postmeasures of disability included mobility difficulty and weighted activities of daily living disability scores ranging from 0 (not disabled) to 100 (completely disabled) based on self-reported health and functional status collected 1 year apart. Among 54,771 person-years (PY) of observation over 7 calendar years of data, 42,890 PY involved no hospitalization, 11,347 PY involved a hospitalization without MV, and 534 PY included a hospitalization with MV. Mortality at 1 year was 8.9%, 23.9%, and 72.5%, respectively. The level of disability at the postassessment was substantially higher for a prototypical patient who survived after hospitalization with MV (adjusted activities of daily living disability score [95% confidence interval] 14.9 [12.2-17.7]; adjusted mobility difficulty score [95% confidence interval] 25.4 [22.4-28.4]) compared with an otherwise identical patient who survived hospitalization without MV (11.5 [11.1-11.9] and 22.3 [21.8-22.9]) or who was not hospitalized (8.0 [7.9-8.1] and 13.4 [13.3-13.6]). CONCLUSIONS: The greater marginal increase in disability among survivors of MV compared with survivors of hospitalization without MV is larger than would be predicted from prior functional status.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Global epidemiological data regarding outcomes for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are scarce, but are important in understanding the worldwide burden of critical illness. We, therefore, did an international audit of ICU patients worldwide and assessed variations between hospitals and countries in terms of ICU mortality. METHODS: 730 participating centres in 84 countries prospectively collected data on all adult (>16 years) patients admitted to their ICU between May 8 and May 18, 2012, except those admitted for fewer than 24 h for routine postoperative monitoring. Participation was voluntary. Data were collected daily for a maximum of 28 days in the ICU and patients were followed up for outcome data until death or hospital discharge. In-hospital death was analysed using multilevel logistic regression with three levels: patient, hospital, and country. FINDINGS: 10,069 patients were included from ICUs in Europe (5445 patients; 54.1%), Asia (1928; 19.2%), the Americas (1723; 17.1%), Oceania (439; 4.4%), the Middle East (393; 3.9%), and Africa (141; 1.4%). Overall, 2973 patients (29.5%) had sepsis on admission or during the ICU stay. ICU mortality rates were 16.2% (95% CI 15.5-16.9) across the whole population and 25.8% (24.2-27.4) in patients with sepsis. Hospital mortality rates were 22.4% (21.6-23.2) in the whole population and 35.3% (33.5-37.1) in patients with sepsis. Using a multilevel analysis, the unconditional model suggested significant between-country variations (var=0.19, p=0.002) and between-hospital variations (var=0.43, p<0.0001) in the individual risk of in-hospital death. There was a stepwise increase in the adjusted risk of in-hospital death according to decrease in global national income. INTERPRETATION: This large database highlights that sepsis remains a major health problem worldwide, associated with high mortality rates in all countries. Our findings also show a significant association between the risk of death and the global national income and suggest that ICU organisation has an important effect on risk of death. FUNDING: None.},

  abstract               = {INTRODUCTION: Severe sepsis is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality, placing a high burden on healthcare resources. We aimed to study outcomes in the five years after severe sepsis. METHODS: This was a cohort study using data from a prospective audit in 26 adult ICUs in Scotland. Mortality was measured using clinical databases and quality of life using Short Form 36 (SF-36) at 3.5 and 5 years after severe sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were recruited with a 58% mortality at 3.5 years and 61% mortality at 5 years. A total of 85 and 67 patients responded at 3.5 and 5 years follow-up, respectively. SF-36 physical component score (PCS) was low compared to population controls at 3.5 years (mean 41.8 (SD 11.8)) and at 5 years (mean 44.8 (SD 12.7)). SF-36 mental component score (MCS) was slightly lower than population controls at 3.5 years (mean 47.7 (SD 14.6)) and at 5 years after severe sepsis (mean 48.8 (SD 12.6)). The majority of patients were satisfied with their current quality of life (QOL) (80%) and all patients would be willing to be treated in an ICU again if they become critically ill despite many having unpleasant memories (19%) and recall (29%) of ICU events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe sepsis have a high ongoing mortality after severe sepsis. They also have a significantly lower physical QOL compared to population norms but mental QOL scores were only slightly below population norms up to five years after severe sepsis. All survivors would be willing to be treated in an ICU again if critically ill. Mortality and QOL outcomes were broadly similar to other critically ill cohorts throughout the five years of follow-up.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: In 2013, New York began requiring hospitals to follow protocols for the early identification and treatment of sepsis. However, there is controversy about whether more rapid treatment of sepsis improves outcomes in patients. METHODS: We studied data from patients with sepsis and septic shock that were reported to the New York State Department of Health from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients had a sepsis protocol initiated within 6 hours after arrival in the emergency department and had all items in a 3-hour bundle of care for patients with sepsis (i.e., blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents, and lactate measurement) completed within 12 hours. Multilevel models were used to assess the associations between the time until completion of the 3-hour bundle and risk-adjusted mortality. We also examined the times to the administration of antibiotics and to the completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluid. RESULTS: Among 49,331 patients at 149 hospitals, 40,696 (82.5%) had the 3-hour bundle completed within 3 hours. The median time to completion of the 3-hour bundle was 1.30 hours (interquartile range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the administration of antibiotics was 0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), and the median time to completion of the fluid bolus was 2.56 hours (interquartile range, 1.33 to 4.20). Among patients who had the 3-hour bundle completed within 12 hours, a longer time to the completion of the bundle was associated with higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; P<0.001), as was a longer time to the administration of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06; P<0.001) but not a longer time to the completion of a bolus of intravenous fluids (odds ratio, 1.01 per hour; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02; P=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: More rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and rapid administration of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluids, were associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality.

The development and progression of sepsis is multi-factorial, and affects the cardiovascular, immunological and endocrine systems of the body. The complexity of sepsis makes the clinical study of sepsis and sepsis therapeutics difficult. Animal models have been developed in an effort to create reproducible systems for studying sepsis pathogenesis and preliminary testing of potential therapeutic agents. However, demonstrated benefit from a therapeutic agent in animal models has rarely been translated into success in human clinical trials. This review summarizes the common animal sepsis models and highlights how results of recent human clinical trials might affect their use.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis continues to be a major cause of death, disability, and health-care expenditure worldwide. Despite evidence suggesting that host genetics can influence sepsis outcomes, no specific loci have yet been convincingly replicated. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that influence sepsis survival. METHODS: We did a genome-wide association study in three independent cohorts of white adult patients admitted to intensive care units with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock (as defined by the International Consensus Criteria) due to pneumonia or intra-abdominal infection (cohorts 1-3, n=2534 patients). The primary outcome was 28 day survival. Results for the cohort of patients with sepsis due to pneumonia were combined in a meta-analysis of 1553 patients from all three cohorts, of whom 359 died within 28 days of admission to the intensive-care unit. The most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a further 538 white patients with sepsis due to pneumonia (cohort 4), of whom 106 died. FINDINGS: In the genome-wide meta-analysis of three independent pneumonia cohorts (cohorts 1-3), common variants in the FER gene were strongly associated with survival (p=9.7 x 10(-8)). Further genotyping of the top associated SNP (rs4957796) in the additional cohort (cohort 4) resulted in a combined p value of 5.6 x 10(-8) (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.69). In a time-to-event analysis, each allele reduced the mortality over 28 days by 44% (hazard ratio for death 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.69; likelihood ratio test p=3.4 x 10(-9), after adjustment for age and stratification by cohort). Mortality was 9.5% in patients carrying the CC genotype, 15.2% in those carrying the TC genotype, and 25.3% in those carrying the TT genotype. No significant genetic associations were identified when patients with sepsis due to pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection were combined. INTERPRETATION: We have identified common variants in the FER gene that associate with a reduced risk of death from sepsis due to pneumonia. The FER gene and associated molecular pathways are potential novel targets for therapy or prevention and candidates for the development of biomarkers for risk stratification.

  abstract               = {Sepsis is the dysregulated host response to an infection which leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction that varies by host genomic factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 740 adult septic patients and focused on 28day mortality as outcome. Variants with suggestive evidence for an association (p</=10(-5)) were validated in two additional GWA studies (n=3470) and gene coding regions related to the variants were assessed in an independent exome sequencing study (n=74). In the discovery GWAS, we identified 243 autosomal variants which clustered in 14 loci (p</=10(-5)). The best association signal (rs117983287; p=8.16x10(-8)) was observed for a missense variant located at chromosome 9q21.2 in the VPS13A gene. VPS13A was further supported by additional GWAS (p=0.03) and sequencing data (p=0.04). Furthermore, CRISPLD2 (p=5.99x10(-6)) and a region on chromosome 13q21.33 (p=3.34x10(-7)) were supported by both our data and external biological evidence. We found 14 loci with suggestive evidence for an association with 28day mortality and found supportive, converging evidence for three of them in independent data sets. Elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms of VPS13A, CRISPLD2, and the chromosome 13 locus should be a focus of future research activities.},

  abstract           = {To assess genetic and environmental influences on adult mortality, we followed 960 families that included children born during the period 1924 through 1926 who were placed early in life with adoptive parents unrelated to them. We evaluated the risks of dying from all causes or from specific groups of causes between the ages of 16 and 58 years for adoptees with a biologic or adoptive parent who died of the same cause before the age of either 50 or 70. We compared these risks with the adoptees' risk of dying from the same causes between the ages of 16 and 58 when either the biologic or adoptive parents were still alive at the ages of 50 and 70. The death of a biologic parent before the age of 50 resulted in relative risks of death in the adoptees of 1.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.14 to 2.57) for all causes, 1.98 (1.25 to 3.12) for natural causes, 5.81 (2.47 to 13.7) for infections, 4.52 (1.32 to 15.4) for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular causes, and 1.19 (0.16 to 8.99) for cancers. The death of an adoptive parent resulted in relative risks of death in the adoptees that were close to unity for all causes, natural causes, and infections, 3.02 (0.72 to 12.8) for vascular causes, and 5.16 (1.20 to 22.2) for cancers. A similar but weaker pattern was observed when either a biologic or adoptive parent died before the age of 70. We conclude that premature death in adults has a strong genetic background--especially death due to infections and vascular causes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract               = {OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies demonstrate that inherited factors play a major role in the development and prognosis of sepsis. However, genetic association studies in sepsis have produced contradictory evidence of an effect from individual polymorphisms. Major methodological flaws have been reported in a number of genetic association studies in non-septic populations, relating to problems with experimental design, statistical analysis, study size, power and replication. We hypothesised that genetic association studies investigating sepsis suffer from similar problems, and that this explains the lack of consistent evidence for an effect from polymorphisms. DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted of published genetic association studies in sepsis from 1996-2005 using a newly devised scoring system for study quality and rigour. A Bayesian statistical analysis was also carried out to assess the false-positive report probability of identified studies. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Study quality was assessed using a 10-point scoring system designed from published reporting guidelines. The majority of studies were of low to intermediate quality, with deficiencies in control group selection, genetic assay technique, study blinding, statistical interpretation, study replication, study size and power. Bayesian analysis indicated that many of the studies reporting a positive association between a genetic polymorphism and sepsis were likely to represent false-positive associations. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and size of genetic association studies in septic patients needs to improve if advances in identifying genetic effects in sepsis are to occur. Investigators should, as a minimum, follow recommended guidelines when designing studies.},

  abstract               = {Injured patients with lung contusion (LC) are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia (PNA) followed by sepsis and death. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed FER gene expression positively correlating with survival rates among individuals with above conditions. We sought to determine whether electroporation (EP)-mediated delivery of FER gene could indeed improve survival, in a lethal model of combined LC and PNA. C57BL/6 mice sustained unilateral LC, which preceded a 500 Klebsiella colony forming unit (CFU) inoculation by 6 h. In-between these insults, human FER plasmid (pFER) was introduced into the lungs followed by eight EP pulses applied externally (10 ms at 200 V cm(-1)). Control groups included EP of empty vector (pcDNA3) or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase genes (pPump) and no treatment (LC+PNA). We recorded survival, histology, lung mechanics, bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, FER and inflammatory gene expression and bacteriology. The data show that 7-day survival was significantly improved by pFER compared with control groups. pFER increased BAL monocytes and activated antibacterial response genes (nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Fizz). pFER treatment showed decreased lung and blood Klebsiella counts reaching, in some cases, complete sterilization. In conclusion, FER gene delivery promoted survival in LC+PNA mice via recruitment of activated immune cells, improving efficiency of bacterial clearance within contused lung.},

This observational cohort study determined whether host gene expression patterns discriminate noninfectious from infectious illness and bacterial from viral causes of acute respiratory infection in the acute care setting. Peripheral whole blood gene expression from 273 subjects with community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or noninfectious illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using microarrays. Sparse logistic regression was used to develop classifiers for bacterial ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of illness (26 probes). Overall accuracy was 87% (238 of 273 concordant with clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than procalcitonin (78%, P < 0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection (78 to 83%). The classifiers developed here externally validated in five publicly available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A sixth publicly available data set included 25 patients with co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Applying the ARI classifiers defined four distinct groups: a host response to bacterial ARI, viral ARI, coinfection, and neither a bacterial nor a viral response. These findings create an opportunity to develop and use host gene expression classifiers as diagnostic platforms to combat inappropriate antibiotic use and emerging antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract               = {The acute phase of sepsis is characterized by a strong inflammatory reaction. At later stages in some patients, immunoparalysis may be encountered, which is associated with a poor outcome. By transcriptional and metabolic profiling of human patients with sepsis, we found that a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis was an important component of initial activation of host defense. Blocking metabolic pathways with metformin diminished cytokine production and increased mortality in systemic fungal infection in mice. In contrast, in leukocytes rendered tolerant by exposure to lipopolysaccharide or after isolation from patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis, a generalized metabolic defect at the level of both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism was apparent, which was restored after recovery of the patients. Finally, the immunometabolic defects in humans were partially restored by therapy with recombinant interferon-gamma, which suggested that metabolic processes might represent a therapeutic target in sepsis.},

Several groups have used gene expression microarrays to build classifiers for acute infections, but these have been hampered by the size of the gene sets, use of overfit models, or lack of independent validation. We used multicohort analysis to derive a set of seven genes for robust discrimination of bacterial and viral infections, which we then validated in 30 independent cohorts. We next used our previously published 11-gene Sepsis MetaScore together with the new bacterial/viral classifier to build an integrated antibiotics decision model. In a pooled analysis of 1057 samples from 20 cohorts (excluding infants), the integrated antibiotics decision model had a sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infections of 94.0 and 59.8%, respectively (negative likelihood ratio, 0.10). Prospective clinical validation will be needed before these findings are implemented for patient care.},

  abstract               = {Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits have yielded more reproducible associations than had been discovered using any other approach, the loci characterized to date do not account for much of the heritability to such traits and, in general, have not led to improved understanding of the biology underlying complex phenotypes. Using a web site we developed to serve results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HapMap samples (http://www.scandb.org), we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits (from http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) are significantly more likely to be eQTLs than minor-allele-frequency-matched SNPs chosen from high-throughput GWAS platforms. These findings are robust across a range of thresholds for establishing eQTLs (p-values from 10(-4)-10(-8)), and a broad spectrum of human complex traits. Analyses of GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust studies confirm that annotating SNPs with a score reflecting the strength of the evidence that the SNP is an eQTL can improve the ability to discover true associations and clarify the nature of the mechanism driving the associations. Our results showing that trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs and that application of this information can enhance discovery of trait-associated SNPs for complex phenotypes raise the possibility that we can utilize this information both to increase the heritability explained by identifiable genetic factors and to gain a better understanding of the biology underlying complex traits.},

Among 20 genomic annotation sets, reported TASs were significantly overrepresented only in nonsynonymous sites [OR = 3.9 (2.2-7.0), p = 3.5 x 10(-7)] and 5kb-promoter regions [OR = 2.3 (1.5-3.6), p = 3 x 10(-4)] compared to SNPs randomly selected from genotyping arrays. Although 88% of TASs were intronic (45%) or intergenic (43%), TASs were not overrepresented in introns and were significantly depleted in intergenic regions [OR = 0.44 (0.34-0.58), p = 2.0 x 10(-9)]. Only slightly more TASs than expected by chance were predicted to be in regions under positive selection [OR = 1.3 (0.8-2.1), p = 0.2]. This new online resource, together with bioinformatic predictions of the underlying functionality at trait/disease-associated loci, is well-suited to guide future investigations of the role of common variants in complex disease etiology.},

The most highly heritable genes ( approximately 777) were grouped into distinct expression clusters, enriched in gene-poor regions, associated with specific gene function or ontology classes, and strongly associated with disease designation. The design enabled a comparison of twin-based heritability to estimates based on dizygotic identity-by-descent sharing and distant genetic relatedness. Consideration of sampling variation suggests that previous heritability estimates have been upwardly biased. Genotyping of 2,494 twins enabled powerful identification of eQTLs, which we further examined in a replication set of 1,895 unrelated subjects. A large number of non-redundant local eQTLs (6,756) met replication criteria, whereas a relatively small number of distant eQTLs (165) met quality control and replication standards. Our results provide a new resource toward understanding the genetic control of transcription.},

More than half of cis-eQTLs identified, involving hundreds of genes and associated pathways, are detected specifically in stimulated monocytes. Induced innate immune activity reveals multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), coding variants altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-beta cytokine network showing temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor-modulated network. Induced eQTL are significantly enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying context-specific associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and IRF8.

  abstract               = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem. One-third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the etiological agent causing TB, and active disease kills nearly 2 million individuals worldwide every year. Several lines of evidence indicate that interindividual variation in susceptibility to TB has a heritable component, yet we still know little about the underlying genetic architecture. To address this, we performed a genome-wide mapping study of loci that are associated with functional variation in immune response to MTB. Specifically, we characterized transcript and protein expression levels and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in primary dendritic cells (DCs) from 65 individuals, before and after infection with MTB. We found 198 response eQTL, namely loci that were associated with variation in gene expression levels in either untreated or MTB-infected DCs, but not both. These response eQTL are associated with natural regulatory variation that likely affects (directly or indirectly) host interaction with MTB. Indeed, when we integrated our data with results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for pulmonary TB, we found that the response eQTL were more likely to be genetically associated with the disease. We thus identified a number of candidate loci, including the MAPK phosphatase DUSP14 in particular, that are promising susceptibility genes to pulmonary TB.},

  abstract               = {The worst known H1N1 influenza pandemic in history resulted in more than 20 million deaths in 1918 and 1919. Although the underlying mechanism causing the extreme virulence of the 1918 influenza virus is still obscure, our previous functional genomics analyses revealed a correlation between the lethality of the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus (r1918) in mice and a unique gene expression pattern associated with severe immune responses in the lungs. Lately, microRNAs have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression. To determine whether differential expression of cellular microRNAs plays a role in the host response to r1918 infection, we compared the lung cellular "microRNAome" of mice infected by r1918 virus with that of mice infected by a nonlethal seasonal influenza virus, A/Texas/36/91. We found that a group of microRNAs, including miR-200a and miR-223, were differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection and that r1918 and A/Texas/36/91 infection induced distinct microRNA expression profiles. Moreover, we observed significant enrichment in the number of predicted cellular target mRNAs whose expression was inversely correlated with the expression of these microRNAs. Intriguingly, gene ontology analysis revealed that many of these mRNAs play roles in immune response and cell death pathways, which are known to be associated with the extreme virulence of r1918. This is the first demonstration that cellular gene expression patterns in influenza virus-infected mice may be attributed in part to microRNA regulation and that such regulation may be a contributing factor to the extreme virulence of the r1918.},

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for several diseases, but their correlation with sepsis is not totally clarified. METHODS: Seven miRNAs related to inflammation or infection were included in the present study. Serum miRNA expression was investigated in 50 patients diagnosed with sepsis, 30 patients with SIRS and 20 healthy controls to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value. Expression levels of serum miRNAs were determined by quantitative PCR using the Qiagen miScript system. Serum CRP and IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Serum miR-146a and miR-223 were significantly reduced in septic patients compared with SIRS patients and healthy controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of miR-146a, miR-223 and IL-6 were 0.858, 0.804 and 0.785, respectively. CONCLUSION: Serum miR-146a and miR-223 might serve as new biomarkers for sepsis with high specificity and sensitivity. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00862290.).},

The aim of this study was to investigate a diagnostic role for serum miRNAs in sepsis patients. METHODS: We recruited 166 patients with sepsis and 24 normal controls. Blood samples for these patients were obtained upon their admission in intensive care units of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The expression levels of miR-223, miR-15b, miR-483-5p, miR-499-5p, miR-122, and miR-193b* were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-223 were significantly higher in patients with mild sepsis (p < 0.001) and patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (p < 0.001) than in normal controls, and levels of miR-499-5p, miR-122, and miR-193b* were significantly lower than in normal controls. In addition, only miR-223 (p = 0.035) and miR-499-5p (p < 0.001) were significantly different between patients with mild sepsis and patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. miR-499-5p had the highest area under a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.686 (95% confidence interval, 0.592-0.779). In addition, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (p < 0.001), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (p < 0.001), and procalcitonin levels (p < 0.001) also could distinguish a mild sepsis group from a severe sepsis and septic shock group. In a binary logistic regression model, only miR-499-5p and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores had good diagnostic values to distinguish between mild sepsis and severe sepsis and septic shock. CONCLUSION: Four serum miRNAs were identified as novel biomarkers of sepsis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, diagnostic study.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dysregulation of miR-223 was recently linked to various diseases associated with systemic inflammatory responses such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and bacterial infections. However, contradictory results are available on potential alterations of miR-223 serum levels during sepsis. We thus aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-223 serum concentrations in patients with critical illness and sepsis. METHODS: We used i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as cecal pole ligation and puncture (CLP) for induction of polymicrobial sepsis in mice and measured alterations in serum levels of miR-223. These results from mice were translated into a large and well-characterized cohort of critically ill patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). Finally, results from analysis in patients were correlated with clinical data and extensive sets of routine and experimental biomarkers. RESULTS: Although LPS injection induced moderately elevated serum miR-223 levels in mice, no significant alterations in miR-223 serum levels were found in mice after CLP-induced sepsis. In accordance with these results from animal models, serum miR-223 levels did not differ between critically ill patients and healthy controls. However, ICU patients with more severe disease (APACHE-II score) showed moderately reduced circulating miR-223. Strikingly, no differences in miR-223 levels were found in critically ill patients with or without sepsis, and serum levels of miR-223 did not correlate with classical markers of inflammation or bacterial infection. Finally, low miR-223 serum levels were moderately associated with an unfavorable prognosis of patients during the ICU treatment but did not predict long-term mortality. CONCLUSION: Recent reports on alterations in miR-223 serum levels during sepsis revealed contradictory results, preventing a potential use of this miRNA in clinical routine. We clearly show that miR-223 serum levels do not reflect the presence of sepsis neither in mouse models nor in a large cohort of ICU patients and do not indicate clinical outcome of critically ill patients. Thus miR-223 serum levels should not be used as a biomarker in this setting.},

Elucidating the molecular processes that differ between sepsis patients who survive and those who die may permit more appropriate treatments to be deployed. We examined the clinical features and the plasma metabolome and proteome of patients with and without community-acquired sepsis, upon their arrival at hospital emergency departments and 24 hours later. The metabolomes and proteomes of patients at hospital admittance who would ultimately die differed markedly from those of patients who would survive. The different profiles of proteins and metabolites clustered into the following groups: fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. They differed consistently among several sets of patients, and diverged more as death approached. In contrast, the metabolomes and proteomes of surviving patients with mild sepsis did not differ from survivors with severe sepsis or septic shock. An algorithm derived from clinical features together with measurements of five metabolites predicted patient survival. This algorithm may help to guide the treatment of individual patients with sepsis.},

We investigated plasma proinflammatory cytokine profiles in patients with sepsis due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and studied the cytokine production and differential gene regulation of leukocytes stimulated ex vivo with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 binding protein, procalcitonin, and protein C in plasma did not differ between patients with sepsis due to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. However, plasma IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with sepsis due to gram-positive bacteria. Ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with heat-killed S. aureus markedly increased IL-1beta and IL-18 levels more than E. coli lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Microarray analysis revealed at least 359 cross-validated probe sets (genes) significant at the P < 0.001 level whose expression discriminated among gram-negative-organism-stimulated, gram-positive-organism-stimulated, and unstimulated whole-blood leukocytes. The host inflammatory responses to gram-negative and gram-positive stimuli share some common response elements but also exhibit distinct patterns of cytokine appearance and leukocyte gene expression.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children globally. Clinical algorithms remain suboptimal for distinguishing severe pneumonia from other causes of respiratory distress such as malaria or distinguishing bacterial pneumonia and pneumonia from others causes, such as viruses. Molecular tools could improve diagnosis and management. METHODS: We conducted a mass spectrometry-based proteomic study to identify and validate markers of severity in 390 Gambian children with pneumonia (n = 204) and age-, sex-, and neighborhood-matched controls (n = 186). Independent validation was conducted in 293 Kenyan children with respiratory distress (238 with pneumonia, 41 with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and 14 with both). Predictive value was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Lipocalin 2 (Lpc-2) was the best protein biomarker of severe pneumonia (AUC, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, .64-.79]) and highly predictive of bacteremia (78% [64%-92%]), pneumococcal bacteremia (84% [71%-98%]), and "probable bacterial etiology" (91% [84%-98%]). These results were validated in Kenyan children with severe malaria and respiratory distress who also met the World Health Organization definition of pneumonia. The combination of Lpc-2 and haptoglobin distinguished bacterial versus malaria origin of respiratory distress with high sensitivity and specificity in Gambian children (AUC, 99% [95% confidence interval, 99%-100%]) and Kenyan children (82% [74%-91%]). CONCLUSIONS: Lpc-2 and haptoglobin can help discriminate the etiology of clinically defined pneumonia and could be used to improve clinical management. These biomarkers should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.},

  abstract               = {Infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Premature neonates are particularly susceptible to infection because of physiologic immaturity, comorbidity, and extraneous medical interventions. Additionally premature infants are at higher risk of progression to sepsis or severe sepsis, adverse outcomes, and antimicrobial toxicity. Currently initial diagnosis is based upon clinical suspicion accompanied by nonspecific clinical signs and is confirmed upon positive microbiologic culture results several days after institution of empiric therapy. There exists a significant need for rapid, objective, in vitro tests for diagnosis of infection in neonates who are experiencing clinical instability. We used immunoassays multiplexed on microarrays to identify differentially expressed serum proteins in clinically infected and non-infected neonates. Immunoassay arrays were effective for measurement of more than 100 cytokines in small volumes of serum available from neonates. Our analyses revealed significant alterations in levels of eight serum proteins in infected neonates that are associated with inflammation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Specifically P- and E-selectins, interleukin 2 soluble receptor alpha, interleukin 18, neutrophil elastase, urokinase plasminogen activator and its cognate receptor, and C-reactive protein were observed at statistically significant increased levels. Multivariate classifiers based on combinations of serum analytes exhibited better diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than single analytes. Multiplexed immunoassays of serum cytokines may have clinical utility as an adjunct for rapid diagnosis of infection and differentiation of etiologic agent in neonates with clinical decompensation.},

Their pathogenicity results from strong and often highly specific interactions they have with either their microbial environment, hosts and/or arthropod vectors. In this review, we explore the contribution of metagenomic approaches toward understanding pathogens within the context of microbial communities. With this broader view, we discussed the concept of "pathobiome" and the research questions that this raises.},

How such enteric viruses establish persistent infections is not well understood. We found that antibiotics prevented persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection, an effect that was reversed by replenishment of the bacterial microbiota. Antibiotics did not prevent tissue infection or affect systemic viral replication but acted specifically in the intestine. The receptor for the antiviral cytokine interferon-lambda, Ifnlr1, as well as the transcription factors Stat1 and Irf3, were required for antibiotics to prevent viral persistence. Thus, the bacterial microbiome fosters enteric viral persistence in a manner counteracted by specific components of the innate immune system.},

  abstract               = {Although commensal bacteria are crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis of the intestine, the role of commensal bacteria in immune responses at other mucosal surfaces remains less clear. Here, we show that commensal microbiota composition critically regulates the generation of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and antibody responses following respiratory influenza virus infection. By using various antibiotic treatments, we found that neomycin-sensitive bacteria are associated with the induction of productive immune responses in the lung. Local or distal injection of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands could rescue the immune impairment in the antibiotic-treated mice. Intact microbiota provided signals leading to the expression of mRNA for pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 at steady state. Following influenza virus infection, inflammasome activation led to migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the lung to the draining lymph node and T-cell priming. Our results reveal the importance of commensal microbiota in regulating immunity in the respiratory mucosa through the proper activation of inflammasomes.},

Given that bacteria use signals to communicate and regulate group behaviors (quorum sensing), we asked whether such communication between different commensal species can influence the interactions occurring in this environment. We engineered the enteric bacterium, Escherichia coli, to manipulate the levels of the interspecies quorum sensing signal, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), in the mouse intestine and investigated the effect upon antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. E. coli that increased intestinal AI-2 levels altered the composition of the antibiotic-treated gut microbiota, favoring the expansion of the Firmicutes phylum. This significantly increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, to oppose the strong effect of the antibiotic, which had almost cleared the Firmicutes. This demonstrates that AI-2 levels influence the abundance of the major phyla of the gut microbiota, the balance of which is known to influence human health.},

We report that autoimmune arthritis was strongly attenuated in the K/BxN mouse model under germ-free (GF) conditions, accompanied by reductions in serum autoantibody titers, splenic autoantibody-secreting cells, germinal centers, and the splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell population. Neutralization of interleukin-17 prevented arthritis development in specific-pathogen-free K/BxN mice resulting from a direct effect of this cytokine on B cells to inhibit germinal center formation. The systemic deficiencies of the GF animals reflected a loss of Th17 cells from the small intestinal lamina propria. Introduction of a single gut-residing species, segmented filamentous bacteria, into GF animals reinstated the lamina propria Th17 cell compartment and production of autoantibodies, and arthritis rapidly ensued. Thus, a single commensal microbe, via its ability to promote a specific Th cell subset, can drive an autoimmune disease.},

  abstract           = {RATIONALE: Although airway microbiota composition correlates with clinical measures in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, these data are unlikely to provide useful prognostic information at the individual patient level. A system enabling microbiota data to be applied clinically would represent a substantial translational advance. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine whether stratification of patients according to the predominant microbiota taxon can provide improved clinical insight compared with standard diagnostics. METHODS: The presence of bacterial respiratory pathogens was assessed in induced sputum from 107 adult patients by culture, quantitative PCR, and, in 96 samples, by ribosomal gene pyrosequencing. Prospective analysis was performed on samples from 42 of these patients. Microbiological data were correlated with concurrent clinical measures and subsequent outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Microbiota analysis defined three groups: Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated (n = 26), Haemophilus influenzae dominated (n = 34), and other taxa dominated (n = 36). Patients with P. aeruginosa- and H. influenzae-dominated communities had significantly worse lung function, higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and higher sputum levels of IL-8 and IL-1beta. Predominance of P. aeruginosa, followed by Veillonella species, was the best predictor of future exacerbation frequency, with H. influenzae-dominated communities having significantly fewer episodes. Detection of P. aeruginosa was associated with poor lung function and exacerbation frequency, irrespective of analytical strategy. Quantitative PCR revealed significant correlations between H. influenzae levels and sputum IL-8, IL-1beta, and serum CRP. Genus richness was negatively correlated with 24-hour sputum weight, age, serum CRP, sputum IL-1beta, and IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Stratification of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis on the basis of predominant bacterial taxa is more clinically informative than either conventional culture or quantitative PCR-based analysis. Further investigation is now required to assess the mechanistic basis of these associations.},

Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.},

Concordance was observed between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting overlap in the abundance and function of species at different body sites. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially resolved after RA treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or saliva microbiome distinguished individuals with RA from healthy controls, were correlated with clinical measures and could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to therapy. In particular, Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at all three sites and negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at all three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA. Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron, sulfur, zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with RA. Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable. Our results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome composition for prognosis and diagnosis.},

The human microbiome is a source of genetic diversity, a modifier of disease, an essential component of immunity, and a functional entity that influences metabolism and modulates drug interactions. Characterization and analysis of the human microbiome have been greatly catalyzed by advances in genomic technologies. We discuss how these technologies have shaped this emerging field of study and advanced our understanding of the human microbiome. We also identify future challenges, many of which are common to human genetic studies, and predict that in the future, analyzing genetic variation and risk of human disease will sometimes necessitate the integration of human and microbial genomic data sets.},

  abstract               = {Blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils provide immune protection against pathogens, but may also promote tissue injury in inflammatory diseases. Although neutrophils are generally considered to be a relatively homogeneous population, evidence for heterogeneity is emerging. Under steady-state conditions, neutrophil heterogeneity may arise from ageing and replenishment by newly released neutrophils from the bone marrow. Aged neutrophils upregulate CXCR4, a receptor allowing their clearance in the bone marrow, with feedback inhibition of neutrophil production via the IL-17/G-CSF axis, and rhythmic modulation of the haematopoietic stem-cell niche. The aged subset also expresses low levels of L-selectin. Previous studies have suggested that in vitro-aged neutrophils exhibit impaired migration and reduced pro-inflammatory properties. Here, using in vivo ageing analyses in mice, we show that neutrophil pro-inflammatory activity correlates positively with their ageing whilst in circulation. Aged neutrophils represent an overly active subset exhibiting enhanced alphaMbeta2 integrin activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation under inflammatory conditions. Neutrophil ageing is driven by the microbiota via Toll-like receptor and myeloid differentiation factor 88-mediated signalling pathways. Depletion of the microbiota significantly reduces the number of circulating aged neutrophils and dramatically improves the pathogenesis and inflammation-related organ damage in models of sickle-cell disease or endotoxin-induced septic shock. These results identify a role for the microbiota in regulating a disease-promoting neutrophil subset.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVES: Culture-based diagnostics represent the standard of care in septic patients, but are highly insensitive and in many cases unspecific. We recently demonstrated the general feasibility of next-generation sequencing-based diagnostics using free circulating nucleic acids (cell-free DNA) in plasma samples of septic patients. Within the presented investigation, higher performance of next-generation sequencing-based diagnostics was validated by comparison to matched blood cultures. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a prospective, observational, single-center study. SETTING: Surgical ICU of a university hospital and research laboratory. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with septic shock, 20 uninfected patients with elective surgery as control cohort. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From 256 plasma samples of 48 septic patients at up to seven consecutive time points within the 28-day observation period, cell-free DNA was isolated and analyzed by next-generation sequencing and relevance scoring. In parallel, results from culture-based diagnostics (e.g., blood culture) were obtained. Plausibility of blood culture and next-generation sequencing results as well as adequacy of antibiotic therapy was evaluated by an independent expert panel. In contrast to blood culture with a positivity rate of 33% at sepsis onset, the positivity rate for next-generation sequencing-based pathogen identification was 72%. Over the whole study period, blood culture positivity was 11%, and next-generation sequencing positivity was 71%. Ninety-six percent of positive next-generation sequencing results for acute sepsis time points were plausible and would have led to a change to a more adequate therapy in 53% of cases as assessed by the expert evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that next-generation sequencing-based analyses of bloodstream infections provide a valuable diagnostic platform for the identification of clinically relevant pathogens with higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture, indicating that patients might benefit from a more appropriate therapy based on next-generation sequencing-based diagnosis.},

  abstract               = {Community-acquired (CA) sepsis is a major public health problem worldwide, yet the etiology remains unknown for >50% of the patients. Here we applied metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to characterize the human virome in 492 clinical samples (384 sera, 92 pooled nasal and throat swabs, 10 stools, and 6 cerebrospinal fluid samples) from 386 patients (213 adults and 173 children) presenting with CA sepsis who were recruited from 6 hospitals across Vietnam between 2013 and 2015. Specific monoplex PCRs were used subsequently to confirm the presence of viral sequences detected by mNGS. We found sequences related to 47 viral species belonging to 21 families in 358 of 386 (93%) patients, including viruses known to cause human infections. After PCR confirmation, human viruses were found in 52 of 386 patients (13.4%); picornavirus (enteroviruses [n = 14], rhinovirus [n = 5], and parechovirus [n = 2]), hepatitis B virus (n = 10), cytomegalovirus (n = 9), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 5), and rotavirus A (n = 3) were the most common viruses detected. Recently discovered viruses were also found (gemycircularvirus [n = 5] and WU polyomavirus, Saffold virus, salivirus, cyclovirus-VN, and human pegivirus 2 [HPgV2] [n, 1 each]), adding to the growing literature about the geographic distribution of these novel viruses. Notably, sequences related to numerous viruses not previously reported in human tissues were also detected. To summarize, we identified 21 viral species known to be infectious to humans in 52 of 386 (13.4%) patients presenting with CA sepsis of unknown cause. The study, however, cannot directly impute sepsis causation to the viruses identified. The results highlight the fact that it remains a challenge to establish the causative agents in CA sepsis patients, especially in tropical settings such as Vietnam.},

  abstract               = {Thousands of pathogens are known to infect humans, but only a fraction are readily identifiable using current diagnostic methods. Microbial cell-free DNA sequencing offers the potential to non-invasively identify a wide range of infections throughout the body, but the challenges of clinical-grade metagenomic testing must be addressed. Here we describe the analytical and clinical validation of a next-generation sequencing test that identifies and quantifies microbial cell-free DNA in plasma from 1,250 clinically relevant bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and eukaryotic parasites. Test accuracy, precision, bias and robustness to a number of metagenomics-specific challenges were determined using a panel of 13 microorganisms that model key determinants of performance in 358 contrived plasma samples, as well as 2,625 infections simulated in silico and 580 clinical study samples. The test showed 93.7% agreement with blood culture in a cohort of 350 patients with a sepsis alert and identified an independently adjudicated cause of the sepsis alert more often than all of the microbiological testing combined (169 aetiological determinations versus 132). Among the 166 samples adjudicated to have no sepsis aetiology identified by any of the tested methods, sequencing identified microbial cell-free DNA in 62, likely derived from commensal organisms and incidental findings unrelated to the sepsis alert. Analysis of the first 2,000 patient samples tested in the CLIA laboratory showed that more than 85% of results were delivered the day after sample receipt, with 53.7% of reports identifying one or more microorganisms.},

Previously used methods allowed only for the detection of either viable bacteria with low sensitivity or selected species of bacteria. The Next-Generation Sequencing method (NGS) enables the identification of all bacteria in the sample with their taxonomic classification. We used NGS for the analysis of blood samples from healthy volunteers (n = 23) and patients with sepsis (n = 62) to check whether any bacterial DNA exists in the blood of healthy people and to identify bacterial taxonomic profile in the blood of septic patients. The presence of bacterial DNA was found both in septic and healthy subjects; however, bacterial diversity was significantly different (P = 0.002) between the studied groups. Among healthy volunteers, a significant predominance of anaerobic bacteria (76.2 %), of which most were bacteria of the order Bifidobacteriales (73.0 %), was observed. In sepsis, the majority of detected taxa belonged to aerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms (75.1 %). The most striking difference was seen in the case of Actinobacteria phyla, the abundance of which was decreased in sepsis (P < 0.001) and Proteobacteria phyla which was decreased in the healthy volunteers (P < 0.001). Our research shows that bacterial DNA can be detected in the blood of healthy people and that its taxonomic composition is different from the one seen in septic patients. Detection of bacterial DNA in the blood of healthy people may suggest that bacteria continuously translocate into the blood, but not always cause sepsis; this observation can be called DNAemia.},

However, current culture-based methodologies have several drawbacks including their limitation of use to culturable bacterial species. To circumvent these problems, we attempted to detect bacterial DNA in blood using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology. We conducted metagenomic and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from bacteria-spiked blood using an Ion Personal Genome Machine. NGS data was analyzed using our in-house pipeline Genome Search Toolkit and database GenomeSync. The metagenomic sequencing analysis successfully detected three gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria spiked in the blood, which was associated with a significant portion of non-bacterial reads, even though human blood cells were separated by low-speed centrifugation prior to DNA extraction. Sequencing analysis of seven variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon also successfully detected all six bacteria spiked in the blood. The methodology using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was verified using DNA from the blood of six patients with sepsis and four healthy volunteers with potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood being identified at the species level. These findings suggest that our system will be a potential platform for practical diagnosis in the future.},

Diagnostics using molecular markers enable rapid identification of fungi, offer new insights into infectious disease dynamics, and open new possibilities for infectious disease control and prevention. We performed a retrospective study using clinical specimens (N = 233) from patients with suspected fungal infection previously subjected to culture and/or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR. We used these specimens to evaluate a high-throughput screening method for fungal detection using automated DNA extraction (QIASymphony), fungal ribosomal small subunit (18S) rDNA RT-PCR and amplicon sequencing. Fungal sequences were compared with sequences from the curated, commercially available SmartGene IDNS database for pathogen identification. Concordance between 18S rDNA RT-PCR and culture results was 91%, and congruence between 18S rDNA RT-PCR and ITS PCR results was 94%. In addition, 18S rDNA RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing detected fungal pathogens in culture negative (N = 13) and ITS PCR negative specimens (N = 12) from patients with a clinically confirmed fungal infection. Our results support the use of the 18S rDNA RT-PCR diagnostic workflow for rapid and accurate identification of fungal pathogens in clinical specimens.},

Here we present a protocol for generating coding-sequence-complete genomes, comprising an online primer design tool, a novel multiplex PCR enrichment protocol, optimized library preparation methods for the portable MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the Illumina range of instruments, and a bioinformatics pipeline for generating consensus sequences. The MinION protocol does not require an Internet connection for analysis, making it suitable for field applications with limited connectivity. Our method relies on multiplex PCR for targeted enrichment of viral genomes from samples containing as few as 50 genome copies per reaction. Viral consensus sequences can be achieved in 1-2 d by starting with clinical samples and following a simple laboratory workflow. This method has been successfully used by several groups studying Zika virus evolution and is facilitating an understanding of the spread of the virus in the Americas. The protocol can be used to sequence other viral genomes using the online Primal Scheme primer designer software. It is suitable for sequencing either RNA or DNA viruses in the field during outbreaks or as an inexpensive, convenient method for use in the lab.},

  abstract               = {Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) lead to more deaths each year than any other infectious disease category. Despite this, etiologic LRTI pathogens are infrequently identified due to limitations of existing microbiologic tests. In critically ill patients, noninfectious inflammatory syndromes resembling LRTIs further complicate diagnosis. To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we performed metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) on tracheal aspirates from 92 adults with acute respiratory failure and simultaneously assessed pathogens, the airway microbiome, and the host transcriptome. To differentiate pathogens from respiratory commensals, we developed a rules-based model (RBM) and logistic regression model (LRM) in a derivation cohort of 20 patients with LRTIs or noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in an independent validation cohort of 24 patients, both models achieved accuracies of 95.5%. We next developed pathogen, microbiome diversity, and host gene expression metrics to identify LRTI-positive patients and differentiate them from critically ill controls with noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in the validation cohort, the pathogen metric performed with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-1.00), the diversity metric with an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63-0.98), and the host transcriptional classifier with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00). Combining these achieved a negative predictive value of 100%. This study suggests that a single streamlined protocol offering an integrated genomic portrait of pathogen, microbiome, and host transcriptome may hold promise as a tool for LRTI diagnosis.},

  abstract           = {The pathogenesis of infectious diseases depends on the interaction of host and pathogen. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, host and parasite processes can be assessed by dual RNA sequencing of blood from infected patients. We performed dual transcriptome analyses on samples from 46 malaria-infected Gambian children to reveal mechanisms driving the systemic pathophysiology of severe malaria. Integrating these transcriptomic data with estimates of parasite load and detailed clinical information allowed consideration of potentially confounding effects due to differing leukocyte proportions in blood, parasite developmental stage, and whole-body pathogen load. We report hundreds of human and parasite genes differentially expressed between severe and uncomplicated malaria, with distinct profiles associated with coma, hyperlactatemia, and thrombocytopenia. High expression of neutrophil granule-related genes was consistently associated with all severe malaria phenotypes. We observed severity-associated variation in the expression of parasite genes, which determine cytoadhesion to vascular endothelium, rigidity of infected erythrocytes, and parasite growth rate. Up to 99% of human differential gene expression in severe malaria was driven by differences in parasite load, whereas parasite gene expression showed little association with parasite load. Coexpression analyses revealed interactions between human and P. falciparum, with prominent co-regulation of translation genes in severe malaria between host and parasite. Multivariate analyses suggested that increased expression of granulopoiesis and interferon-gamma-related genes, together with inadequate suppression of type 1 interferon signaling, best explained severity of infection. These findings provide a framework for understanding the contributions of host and parasite to the pathogenesis of severe malaria and identifying new treatments.},

  abstract               = {CONTEXT: -The rapid and accurate diagnosis of Zika virus infection is an international priority. OBJECTIVE: -To review current recommendations, methods, limitations, and priorities for Zika virus testing. DATA SOURCES: -Sources include published literature, public health recommendations, laboratory procedures, and testing experience. CONCLUSIONS: -Until recently, the laboratory diagnosis of Zika infection was confined to public health or research laboratories that prepared their own reagents, and test capacity has been limited. Furthermore, Zika cross-reacts serologically with other flaviviruses, such as dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. Current or past infection, or even vaccination with another flavivirus, will often cause false-positive or uninterpretable Zika serology results. Detection of viral RNA during acute infection using nucleic acid amplification tests provides more specific results, and a number of commercial nucleic acid amplification tests have received emergency use authorization. In addition to serum, testing of whole blood and urine is recommended because of the higher vial loads and longer duration of shedding. However, nucleic acid amplification testing has limited utility because many patients are asymptomatic or present for testing after the brief period of Zika shedding has passed. Thus, the greatest need and most difficult challenge is development of accurate antibody tests for the diagnosis of recent Zika infection. Research is urgently needed to identify Zika virus epitopes that do not cross-react with other flavivirus antigens. New information is emerging at a rapid pace and, with ongoing public-private and international collaborations and government support, it is hoped that rapid progress will be made in developing robust and widely applicable diagnostic tools.},

We studied MCC samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. Further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387-base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV). MCV sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) MCC tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. In six of eight MCV-positive MCCs, viral DNA was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that MCV infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Thus, MCV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of MCC.},

Our aim was to examine the risk and determinants of HCC in patients cured with DAA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hepatitis C virus patients who were treated with DAA in any of the 129 Veterans Health Administration hospitals between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. We calculated the annual incidence rates of HCC by SVR. We used Cox regression models to compare the risk of HCC in patients with vs those without SVR and to identify factors associated with incident HCC among patients with SVR. We reviewed a sample of HCC patients for tumor size and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 22,500 patients treated with DAA (19,518 with SVR; 2982 without SVR), the mean (standard deviation) age was 61.6 (6.1) years, and 39.0% had cirrhosis. There were 271 new cases of HCC, including 183 in patients with SVR. Compared with patients without SVR, those with SVR had a significantly reduced risk of HCC (0.90 vs 3.45 HCC/100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.28, 95% CI=0.22-0.36). Patients with cirrhosis had the highest annual incidence of HCC after SVR (1.82 vs 0.34/100 person-years in patients without cirrhosis; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.73. 95% CI, 3.34-6.68). Most (>44.8%) HCC were classified as stage I. Maximum size of the largest lesion was </=5 cm in over 75% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients treated with DAA, SVR was associated with a considerable reduction in the risk of HCC. We did not find any evidence to suggest that DAAs promote HCC. However, in patients with SVR, the absolute risk of HCC remained high in patients with established cirrhosis. These patients should be considered for ongoing HCC surveillance.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is an experimentally neglected severe disease with a substantial burden on human health. Because of technical limitations, little is known about the biology of this important human pathogen. Whole genome analysis methods on patient-derived material are thus likely to have a substantial impact on our understanding of P. vivax pathogenesis and epidemiology. For example, it will allow study of the evolution and population biology of the parasite, allow parasite transmission patterns to be characterized, and may facilitate the identification of new drug resistance genes. Because parasitemias are typically low and the parasite cannot be readily cultured, on-site leukocyte depletion of blood samples is typically needed to remove human DNA that may be 1000X more abundant than parasite DNA. These features have precluded the analysis of archived blood samples and require the presence of laboratories in close proximity to the collection of field samples for optimal pre-cryopreservation sample preparation. RESULTS: Here we show that in-solution hybridization capture can be used to extract P. vivax DNA from human contaminating DNA in the laboratory without the need for on-site leukocyte filtration. Using a whole genome capture method, we were able to enrich P. vivax DNA from bulk genomic DNA from less than 0.5% to a median of 55% (range 20%-80%). This level of enrichment allows for efficient analysis of the samples by whole genome sequencing and does not introduce any gross biases into the data. With this method, we obtained greater than 5X coverage across 93% of the P. vivax genome for four P. vivax strains from Iquitos, Peru, which is similar to our results using leukocyte filtration (greater than 5X coverage across 96% ). CONCLUSION: The whole genome capture technique will enable more efficient whole genome analysis of P. vivax from a larger geographic region and from valuable archived sample collections.},

  abstract               = {UNLABELLED: In vivo transcriptional analyses of microbial pathogens are often hampered by low proportions of pathogen biomass in host organs, hindering the coverage of full pathogen transcriptome. We aimed to address the transcriptome profiles of Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen in systemically infected immunocompromised patients, during systemic infection in different hosts. We developed a strategy for high-resolution quantitative analysis of the C. albicans transcriptome directly from early and late stages of systemic infection in two different host models, mouse and the insect Galleria mellonella. Our results show that transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were enriched for fungal transcripts up to 1,600-fold using biotinylated bait probes to capture C. albicans sequences. This enrichment biased the read counts of only ~3% of the genes, which can be identified and removed based on a priori criteria. This allowed an unprecedented resolution of C. albicans transcriptome in vivo, with detection of over 86% of its genes. The transcriptional response of the fungus was surprisingly similar during infection of the two hosts and at the two time points, although some host- and time point-specific genes could be identified. Genes that were highly induced during infection were involved, for instance, in stress response, adhesion, iron acquisition, and biofilm formation. Of the in vivo-regulated genes, 10% are still of unknown function, and their future study will be of great interest. The fungal RNA enrichment procedure used here will help a better characterization of the C. albicans response in infected hosts and may be applied to other microbial pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Understanding the mechanisms utilized by pathogens to infect and cause disease in their hosts is crucial for rational drug development. Transcriptomic studies may help investigations of these mechanisms by determining which genes are expressed specifically during infection. This task has been difficult so far, since the proportion of microbial biomass in infected tissues is often extremely low, thus limiting the depth of sequencing and comprehensive transcriptome analysis. Here, we adapted a technology to capture and enrich C. albicans RNA, which was next used for deep RNA sequencing directly from infected tissues from two different host organisms. The high-resolution transcriptome revealed a large number of genes that were so far unknown to participate in infection, which will likely constitute a focus of study in the future. More importantly, this method may be adapted to perform transcript profiling of any other microbes during host infection or colonization.},

  abstract               = {UNLABELLED: Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a 100% association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, only three EBV genomes isolated from NPC patients have been sequenced to date, and the role of EBV genomic variations in the pathogenesis of NPC is unclear. We sought to obtain the sequences of EBV genomes in multiple NPC biopsy specimens in the same geographic location in order to reveal their sequence diversity. Three published EBV (B95-8, C666-1, and HKNPC1) genomes were first resequenced using the sequencing workflow of target enrichment of EBV DNA by hybridization, followed by next-generation sequencing, de novo assembly, and joining of contigs by Sanger sequencing. The sequences of eight NPC biopsy specimen-derived EBV (NPC-EBV) genomes, designated HKNPC2 to HKNPC9, were then determined. They harbored 1,736 variations in total, including 1,601 substitutions, 64 insertions, and 71 deletions, compared to the reference EBV. Furthermore, genes encoding latent, early lytic, and tegument proteins and glycoproteins were found to contain nonsynonymous mutations of potential biological significance. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HKNPC6 and -7 genomes, which were isolated from tumor biopsy specimens of advanced metastatic NPC cases, were distinct from the other six NPC-EBV genomes, suggesting the presence of at least two parental lineages of EBV among the NPC-EBV genomes. In conclusion, much greater sequence diversity among EBV isolates derived from NPC biopsy specimens is demonstrated on a whole-genome level through a complete sequencing workflow. Large-scale sequencing and comparison of EBV genomes isolated from NPC and normal subjects should be performed to assess whether EBV genomic variations contribute to NPC pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: This study established a sequencing workflow from EBV DNA capture and sequencing to de novo assembly and contig joining. We reported eight newly sequenced EBV genomes isolated from primary NPC biopsy specimens and revealed the sequence diversity on a whole-genome level among these EBV isolates. At least two lineages of EBV strains are observed, and recombination among these lineages is inferred. Our study has demonstrated the value of, and provided a platform for, genome sequencing of EBV.},

We developed a capture method that uses biotinylated RNA 'baits' to fish targets out of a 'pond' of DNA fragments. The RNA is transcribed from PCR-amplified oligodeoxynucleotides originally synthesized on a microarray, generating sufficient bait for multiple captures at concentrations high enough to drive the hybridization. We tested this method with 170-mer baits that target >15,000 coding exons (2.5 Mb) and four regions (1.7 Mb total) using Illumina sequencing as read-out. About 90% of uniquely aligning bases fell on or near bait sequence; up to 50% lay on exons proper. The uniformity was such that approximately 60% of target bases in the exonic 'catch', and approximately 80% in the regional catch, had at least half the mean coverage. One lane of Illumina sequence was sufficient to call high-confidence genotypes for 89% of the targeted exon space.},

Twelve sequences had A.T/U content varying from 25 to 80% and dPy content in the DNA strands varying from 0 to 100%. Thermodynamic stabilities of four duplexes for each sequence were determined in solution containing 100 mM Na+, 10 mM phosphate, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1. CD spectra and electrophoretic mobility on native polyacrylamide gel were measured for most duplexes. Quantitative correlations of hybrid stability both with deoxypyrimidine content and, at fixed dPy content, with the fraction of A.T/U in duplexes were found. We also demonstrated that hybrids with 70-80% deoxypyrimidine DNA strand and a high or moderate A.T/U fraction displayed the highest relative stability compared to their RNA counterparts. Relationships of relative intensities of CD bands at 210 nm and relative electrophoretic mobilities of hybrids with relative hybrid stability suggested that hybrid conformation varies continuously between A- and B-form and is the decisive factor in relative hybrid stability.},

  abstract               = {Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for characterizing viral populations. It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed approximately 1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into <200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses and has utility for research and clinical applications.},

Our analyses indicate that different T. pallidum subspecies caused similar diagnostic presentations that are normally associated with syphilis in infants, and potential evidence of a congenital infection of T. pallidum ssp. pertenue, the causative agent of yaws.

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Early recognition of causative pathogens is critical for the appropriate management of central nervous system infection and improved outcomes. The BioFire((R)) FilmArray((R)) Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel (BioFire((R)) ME Panel, BioFire Diagnostics) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved multiplex PCR assay that allows the rapid detection of 14 pathogens, including bacteria (n = 6), viruses (n = 7), and fungi (n = 1), from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The performance of the panel is expected to be dependent on the epidemiology of M/E in different geographical regions. METHODS: In this preliminary study, we used the BioFire((R)) ME Panel in 42 subjects who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of M/E in our hospital. The results were compared to conventional culture, antigen detection, PCR, and various laboratory findings. RESULTS: The panel detected six positive samples, of which five were viral and one bacterial. We observed an overall agreement rate of 88% between the BioFire((R)) ME Panel results and the conventional methods. There were no false-positive findings, but five discordant results were observed for enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, Escherichia coli, and Cryptococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: The BioFire((R)) ME Panel performed equivalently to the traditional PCR methods for virus detection, and better than bacterial cultures. This revolutionary system represents a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of M/E and may aid in the rapid identification of community-acquired M/E. However, the usefulness of this tool is limited in regions with a high prevalence of infectious M/E caused by microorganisms not included in the panel.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: Early identification of causative microorganism(s) in patients with severe infection is crucial to optimize antimicrobial use and patient survival. However, current culture-based pathogen identification is slow and unreliable such that broad-spectrum antibiotics are often used to insure coverage of all potential organisms, carrying risks of overtreatment, toxicity, and selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria. We compared the results obtained using a novel, culture-independent polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry technology with those obtained by standard microbiological testing and evaluated the potential clinical implications of this technique. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Nine ICUs in six European countries. PATIENTS: Patients admitted between October 2013 and June 2014 with suspected or proven bloodstream infection, pneumonia, or sterile fluid and tissue infection were considered for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We tested 616 bloodstream infection, 185 pneumonia, and 110 sterile fluid and tissue specimens from 529 patients. From the 616 bloodstream infection samples, polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry identified a pathogen in 228 cases (37%) and culture in just 68 (11%). Culture was positive and polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry negative in 13 cases, and both were negative in 384 cases, giving polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 69%, and negative predictive value of 97% at 6 hours from sample acquisition. The distribution of organisms was similar with both techniques. Similar observations were made for pneumonia and sterile fluid and tissue specimens. Independent clinical analysis of results suggested that polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry technology could potentially have resulted in altered treatment in up to 57% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry provides rapid pathogen identification in critically ill patients. The ability to rule out infection within 6 hours has potential clinical and economic benefits.},

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of this combined approach on clinical and antimicrobial therapy-related outcomes in patients with bloodstream infections. METHODS: A pre-post quasi-experimental study was conducted to analyze the impact of MALDI-TOF with AST intervention in patients with bloodstream infections. The AST provided evidence-based antibiotic recommendations after receiving real-time notification following blood culture Gram stain, organism identification, and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Outcomes were compared to a historic control group. RESULTS: A total of 501 patients with bacteremia or candidemia were included in the final analysis: 245 patients in the intervention group and 256 patients in the preintervention group. MALDI-TOF with AST intervention decreased time to organism identification (84.0 vs 55.9 hours, P < .001), and improved time to effective antibiotic therapy (30.1 vs 20.4 hours, P = .021) and optimal antibiotic therapy (90.3 vs 47.3 hours, P < .001). Mortality (20.3% vs 14.5%), length of intensive care unit stay (14.9 vs 8.3 days) and recurrent bacteremia (5.9% vs 2.0%) were lower in the intervention group on univariate analysis, and acceptance of an AST intervention was associated with a trend toward reduced mortality on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 0.55, P = .075). CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF with AST intervention decreased time to organism identification and time to effective and optimal antibiotic therapy.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Prosthetic joint infections are clinically difficult to diagnose and treat. Previously, we demonstrated metagenomic sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq replicates the findings of current gold standard microbiological diagnostic techniques. Nanopore sequencing offers advantages in speed of detection over MiSeq. Here, we report a real-time analytical pathway for Nanopore sequence data, designed for detecting bacterial composition of prosthetic joint infections but potentially useful for any microbial sequencing, and compare detection by direct-from-clinical-sample metagenomic nanopore sequencing with Illumina sequencing and standard microbiological diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: DNA was extracted from the sonication fluids of seven explanted orthopaedic devices, and additionally from two culture negative controls, and was sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. A specific analysis pipeline was assembled to overcome the challenges of identifying the true infecting pathogen, given high levels of host contamination and unavoidable background lab and kit contamination. The majority of DNA classified (> 90%) was host contamination and discarded. Using negative control filtering thresholds, the species identified corresponded with both routine microbiological diagnosis and MiSeq results. By analysing sequences in real time, causes of infection were robustly detected within minutes from initiation of sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a novel, scalable pipeline for real-time analysis of MinION sequence data and use of this pipeline to show initial proof of concept that metagenomic MinION sequencing can provide rapid, accurate diagnosis for prosthetic joint infections. The high proportion of human DNA in prosthetic joint infection extracts prevents full genome analysis from complete coverage, and methods to reduce this could increase genome depth and allow antimicrobial resistance profiling. The nine samples sequenced in this pilot study have shown a proof of concept for sequencing and analysis that will enable us to investigate further sequencing to improve specificity and sensitivity.},

METHODS: In a 1-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of metagenomic NGS of CSF for the diagnosis of infectious meningitis and encephalitis in hospitalized patients. All positive tests for pathogens on metagenomic NGS were confirmed by orthogonal laboratory testing. Physician feedback was elicited by teleconferences with a clinical microbial sequencing board and by surveys. Clinical effect was evaluated by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: We enrolled 204 pediatric and adult patients at eight hospitals. Patients were severely ill: 48.5% had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and the 30-day mortality among all study patients was 11.3%. A total of 58 infections of the nervous system were diagnosed in 57 patients (27.9%). Among these 58 infections, metagenomic NGS identified 13 (22%) that were not identified by clinical testing at the source hospital. Among the remaining 45 infections (78%), metagenomic NGS made concurrent diagnoses in 19. Of the 26 infections not identified by metagenomic NGS, 11 were diagnosed by serologic testing only, 7 were diagnosed from tissue samples other than CSF, and 8 were negative on metagenomic NGS owing to low titers of pathogens in CSF. A total of 8 of 13 diagnoses made solely by metagenomic NGS had a likely clinical effect, with 7 of 13 guiding treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Routine microbiologic testing is often insufficient to detect all neuroinvasive pathogens. In this study, metagenomic NGS of CSF obtained from patients with meningitis or encephalitis improved diagnosis of neurologic infections and provided actionable information in some cases.

  abstract               = {The gold standard for clinical diagnosis of bacterial lower respiratory infections (LRIs) is culture, which has poor sensitivity and is too slow to guide early, targeted antimicrobial therapy. Metagenomic sequencing could identify LRI pathogens much faster than culture, but methods are needed to remove the large amount of human DNA present in these samples for this approach to be feasible. We developed a metagenomics method for bacterial LRI diagnosis that features efficient saponin-based host DNA depletion and nanopore sequencing. Our pilot method was tested on 40 samples, then optimized and tested on a further 41 samples. Our optimized method (6 h from sample to result) was 96.6% sensitive and 41.7% specific for pathogen detection compared with culture and we could accurately detect antibiotic resistance genes. After confirmatory quantitative PCR and pathobiont-specific gene analyses, specificity and sensitivity increased to 100%. Nanopore metagenomics can rapidly and accurately characterize bacterial LRIs and might contribute to a reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic use.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing is widely used to determine the relative composition of the mammalian gut microbiomes. However, in the absence of a reference, this does not reveal alterations in absolute abundance of specific operational taxonomic units if microbial loads vary across specimens. RESULTS: Here we suggest the spiking of exogenous bacteria into crude specimens to quantify ratios of absolute bacterial abundances. We use the 16S rDNA read counts of the spike-in bacteria to adjust the read counts of endogenous bacteria for changes in total microbial loads. Using a series of dilutions of pooled faecal samples from mice containing defined amounts of the spike-in bacteria Salinibacter ruber, Rhizobium radiobacter and Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus, we demonstrate that spike-in-based calibration to microbial loads allows accurate estimation of ratios of absolute endogenous bacteria abundances. Applied to stool specimens of patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we were able to determine changes in both relative and absolute abundances of various phyla, especially the genus Enterococcus, in response to antibiotic treatment and radio-chemotherapeutic conditioning. CONCLUSION: Exogenous spike-in bacteria in gut microbiome studies enable estimation of ratios of absolute OTU abundances, providing novel insights into the structure and the dynamics of intestinal microbiomes.},

  abstract               = {RATIONALE: The role of viruses in pneumonia in adults and the impact of viral infection on mortality have not been elucidated. Previous studies have significant limitations in that they relied predominantly on upper respiratory specimens. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of viral infection in adult patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort was conducted in a 28-bed medical ICU. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) were included in the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 198 patients (64 with CAP, 134 with HCAP) were included for analysis. Of these, 115 patients (58.1%) underwent bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 104 of whom were tested for respiratory viruses by BAL fluid reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nasopharyngeal specimen RT-PCR was performed in 159 patients (84.1%). Seventy-one patients (35.9%) had a bacterial infection, and 72 patients (36.4%) had a viral infection. Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (23.6%), followed by parainfluenza virus (20.8%), human metapneumovirus (18.1%), influenza virus (16.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (13.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was significantly more common in the CAP group (CAP, 10.9%; HCAP, 2.2%; P = 0.01). The mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral infections, and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different (25.5, 26.5, and 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are frequently found in the airway of patients with pneumonia requiring ICU admission and may cause severe forms of pneumonia. Patients with viral infection and bacterial infection had comparable mortality rates.},

Although there are increasing reports of mNGS successes, several hurdles need to be addressed, such as differentiation of colonization from infection, extraneous sources of nucleic acid, method standardization, and data storage, protection, analysis, and interpretation. As more commercial and clinical microbiology laboratories develop mNGS assays, it is important for treating practitioners to understand both the power and limitations of this method as a diagnostic tool for infectious diseases.},

  abstract               = {The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record, responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 x 10(-3) and 1.42 x 10(-3) mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.},

From a diagnostic perspective, next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers the ability to rapidly identify putative pathogens and predict their antimicrobial resistance profiles to optimize targeted treatment regimens. Since the introduction of metagenomics nearly a decade ago, numerous reports have described successful applications in an increasing variety of biological specimens, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, blood and tissue. Considerable advancements in sequencing and computational technologies in recent years have made CMg a promising tool in clinical microbiology laboratories. Moreover, costs per sample and turnaround time from specimen receipt to clinical management continue to decrease, making the prospect of CMg more feasible. Many difficulties, however, are associated with CMg and warrant further improvements such as the informatics infrastructure and analytical pipelines. Thus, the current review focuses on comprehensively assessing applications of CMg for diagnostic and subtyping purposes.},

We hypothesized that virus-specific factors could contribute to differences in annual excess mortality. Recombinant influenza viruses with neuraminidases from representative strains from the past 50 years were created and characterized. The specific level of their neuraminidase activity correlated with their ability to support secondary bacterial pneumonia. Recombinant viruses with neuraminidases from 1957 and 1997 influenza strains had the highest level of activity, whereas a virus with the neuraminidase from a 1968 strain had the lowest level of activity. The high level of activity of the neuraminidase from the 1957 strain, compared with that of other neuraminidases, more strongly supported the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia in a mouse model. These data lend support to our hypothesis that the influenza virus neuraminidase contributes to secondary bacterial pneumonia and subsequent excess mortality.},

Recent examples show how evolution-guided approaches can provide new insights into host-pathogen interactions, ultimately clarifying the basis of host range and explaining the emergence of different diseases. We describe the latest developments in comparative immunology and evolutionary genetics, showing their relevance for understanding the molecular determinants of infection susceptibility in mammals.},

Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic) that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response.},

This article reviews examples of viruses and bacteria known or thought to induce epigenetic changes in host cells, and how this might contribute to disease. The heritable nature of these processes in gene regulation suggests that they could play important roles in chronic diseases associated with microbial persistence; they might also explain so-called 'hit-and-run' phenomena in infectious disease pathogenesis.},

However, recent findings suggest that organisms have evolved mechanisms to influence the timing or genomic location of heritable variability. Hypervariable contingency loci and epigenetic switches increase the variability of specific phenotypes; error-prone DNA replicases produce bursts of variability in times of stress. Interestingly, these mechanisms seem to tune the variability of a given phenotype to match the variability of the acting selective pressure. Although these observations do not undermine Darwin's theory, they suggest that selection and variability are less independent than once thought.},

  abstract               = {INTRODUCTION: The Tie2/angiopoietin (Tie2/Ang) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-ligand systems (VEGFR/VEGF) are recognized to play important roles in the regulation of microvascular endothelial function. Downregulation of these genes during sepsis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-related microvascular leak and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Mechanisms responsible for dysregulation of angiogenic genes in sepsis are poorly defined. METHODS: Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and multiplex chromatin immunoprecipitation platform (Matrix ChIP) were used to investigate serum albumin leak, changes in gene expression, and associated epigenetic alterations in a murine model of acute lung injury-induced sepsis (ALI-sepsis). RESULTS: Experimental ALI-sepsis induced microvascular leak and downregulation of expression of Angpt1 (Ang1), Tek (Tie2), and Kdr (Vegfr2 or Flk-1) genes in the lung, kidney, and liver. These changes correlate with a decrease in RNA polymerase II density at these genes, and the greatest response was observed in the lung. ALI-sepsis reduced levels of transcription-permissive histone H3 lysine acetylation (H3KAc) at these loci in all examined tissues. Decreases in permissive H3K4m3 and H3Km2 marks were detected only in the lung. In contrast, only minimal alterations in transcription-repressive histone modifications (H3K27m3, H3K9m2, H3K9m3, and H4K20m3) were observed in all tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that decreases in transcription-permissive, but not increases in transcription-repressive, histone modifications at Angpt1, Tek, and Kdr are a systemic, rather than a lung-restricted, response, involving key end-organs in experimental ALI-sepsis. Given that ventilator-associated pneumonia is a major cause of sepsis in critically ill patients, elucidation of mechanisms mediating epigenetic alterations during sepsis provides fundamental new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced microvascular leak and subsequent end-organ injury/dysfunction.},

  abstract           = {Although several dozen studies of gene expression in sepsis have been published, distinguishing sepsis from a sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is still largely up to clinical suspicion. We hypothesized that a multicohort analysis of the publicly available sepsis gene expression data sets would yield a robust set of genes for distinguishing patients with sepsis from patients with sterile inflammation. A comprehensive search for gene expression data sets in sepsis identified 27 data sets matching our inclusion criteria. Five data sets (n = 663 samples) compared patients with sterile inflammation (SIRS/trauma) to time-matched patients with infections. We applied our multicohort analysis framework that uses both effect sizes and P values in a leave-one-data set-out fashion to these data sets. We identified 11 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate </=1%, inter-data set heterogeneity P > 0.01, summary effect size >1.5-fold) across all discovery cohorts with excellent diagnostic power [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.87; range, 0.7 to 0.98]. We then validated these 11 genes in 15 independent cohorts comparing (i) time-matched infected versus noninfected trauma patients (4 cohorts), (ii) ICU/trauma patients with infections over the clinical time course (3 cohorts), and (iii) healthy subjects versus sepsis patients (8 cohorts). In the discovery Glue Grant cohort, SIRS plus the 11-gene set improved prediction of infection (compared to SIRS alone) with a continuous net reclassification index of 0.90. Overall, multicohort analysis of time-matched cohorts yielded 11 genes that robustly distinguish sterile inflammation from infectious inflammation.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. RESULTS: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.},

  abstract               = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface. RESULTS: With data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves. Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC. CONCLUSIONS: pROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation. pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software.

  abstract               = {MOTIVATION: Over the last few years, methods based on suffix arrays using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform have been widely used for DNA sequence read matching and assembly. These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient. Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed, which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by genotype algorithms. RESULTS: Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than O(NM(2)) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and phasing.},

  abstract               = {Haplotype phasing is a fundamental problem in medical and population genetics. Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a approximately 20x speedup and approximately 10% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves >2x the accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing. Eagle2 is open source and freely available for HRC-based phasing via the Sanger Imputation Service and the Michigan Imputation Server.},
